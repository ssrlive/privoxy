/* On Unix systems config.in is converted by configure into config.h. PCRE is
written in Standard C, but there are a few non-standard things it can cope
with, allowing it to run on SunOS4 and other "close to standard" systems.

On a non-Unix system you should just copy this file into config.h and change
the definitions of HAVE_STRERROR and HAVE_MEMMOVE to 1. Unfortunately, because
of the way autoconf works, these cannot be made the defaults. If your system
has bcopy() and not memmove(), change the definition of HAVE_BCOPY instead of
HAVE_MEMMOVE. If your system has neither bcopy() nor memmove(), leave them both
as 0; an emulation function will be used. */

/* The following two definitions are mainly for the benefit of SunOS4, which
doesn't have the strerror() or memmove() functions that should be present in
all Standard C libraries. The macros HAVE_STRERROR and HAVE_MEMMOVE should
normally be defined with the value 1 for other systems, but unfortunately we
can't make this the default because "configure" files generated by autoconf
will only change 0 to 1; they won't change 1 to 0 if the functions are not
found. If HAVE_MEMMOVE is set to 1, the value of HAVE_BCOPY is not relevant. */
