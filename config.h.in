 * Purpose     :  This file should be the first thing included in every
 *                .c file.  (Before even system headers).  It contains 
 *                #define statements for various features.  It was
 *                introduced because the compile command line started
 *                getting ludicrously long with feature defines.

 * Revisions   :
 *    $Log: acconfig.h,v $
 *    Revision 1.3  2001/05/26 01:26:34  jongfoster
 *    New #define, WIN_GUI_EDIT, enables the (embryonic) Win32 GUI editor.
 *    This #define cannot be set from ./configure - there's no point, it
 *    doesn't work yet.  See feature request # 425722
 *
 *    Revision 1.2  2001/05/22 17:43:35  oes
 *
 *    - Enabled filtering banners by size rather than URL
 *      by adding patterns that replace all standard banner
 *      sizes with the "Junkbuster" gif to the re_filterfile
 *
 *    - Enabled filtering WebBugs by providing a pattern
 *      which kills all 1x1 images
 *
 *    - Added support for PCRE_UNGREEDY behaviour to pcrs,
 *      which is selected by the (nonstandard and therefore
 *      capital) letter 'U' in the option string.
 *      It causes the quantifiers to be ungreedy by default.
 *      Appending a ? turns back to greedy (!).
 *
 *    - Added a new interceptor ijb-send-banner, which
 *      sends back the "Junkbuster" gif. Without imagelist or
 *      MSIE detection support, or if tinygif = 1, or the
 *      URL isn't recognized as an imageurl, a lame HTML
 *      explanation is sent instead.
 *
 *    - Added new feature, which permits blocking remote
 *      script redirects and firing back a local redirect
 *      to the browser.
 *      The feature is conditionally compiled, i.e. it
 *      can be disabled with --disable-fast-redirects,
 *      plus it must be activated by a "fast-redirects"
 *      line in the config file, has its own log level
 *      and of course wants to be displayed by show-proxy-args
 *      Note: Boy, all the #ifdefs in 1001 locations and
 *      all the fumbling with configure.in and acconfig.h
 *      were *way* more work than the feature itself :-(
 *
 *    - Because a generic redirect template was needed for
 *      this, tinygif = 3 now uses the same.
 *
 *    - Moved GIFs, and other static HTTP response templates
 *      to project.h
 *
 *    - Many minor fixes
 *
 *    - Removed some >400 CRs again (Jon, you really worked
 *      a lot! ;-)
 *
 *    Revision 1.1.1.1  2001/05/15 13:58:45  oes
 *    Initial import of version 2.9.3 source tree

 * You must also define IMAGE_BLOCKING to use this feature.

 * It detects the following header pair as an image request:

 * Accept: * / *
 *
 * And the following as a HTML request:

 *
 * Known limitations: 
 * 1) If you press shift-reload on a blocked HTML page, you get
 *    the image "blocked" page, not the HTML "blocked" page.
 * 2) Once an image "blocked" page has been sent, viewing it 
 *    in it's own browser window *should* bring up the HTML
 *    "blocked" page, but it doesn't.  You need to clear the 
 *    browser cache to get the HTML version again.
 *
 * These limitations are due to IE making inconsistent choices
 * about which "Accept:" header to send.
