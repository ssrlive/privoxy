<para>
 At present, <application>Privoxy</application> is known to run on Win32, Mac
 OSX, OS/2, AmigaOS, Linux (RedHat, Suse, Debian), FreeBSD, NetBSD, BeOS, and
 many flavors of Unix.
</para>

<![%p-supp-userman;[
<para>
 But any operating system that runs TCP/IP, can conceivably take advantage of
 <application>Privoxy</application> in a networked situation where
 <application>Privoxy</application> would run as a server on a LAN gateway. 
 Then only the <quote>gateway</quote> needs to be running one of the above
 operating systems. 
</para>

<para>
 Source code is freely available, so porting to other operating systems, 
 is always a possibility.
