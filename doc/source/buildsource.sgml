<para>
 To build <application>Privoxy</application> from source, 
 autoheader, autoconf,GNU make (gmake), and, of course, a C 
 compiler are required.
</para>

<para>
 When building from a source tarball (either release version or
 nightly CVS tarball), first unpack the source: 
</para>

<para>
 <screen>
 tar xzvf privoxy-&p-version;<![%p-not-stable;[-beta]]>-src* [.tgz or .tar.gz]
 cd privoxy-&p-version;<![%p-not-stable;[-beta]]>
 </screen>
</para>

<para>
 For retrieving the current CVS sources, you'll need CVS installed.
 Note that sources from CVS are development quality, and may not be
 stable, or well tested. To download CVS source:
</para>

<para>
 <screen>
  cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.ijbswa.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/ijbswa login
  cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.ijbswa.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/ijbswa co current
  cd current
 </screen>
</para>

<para>
 This will create a directory named <filename>current/</filename>, which will 
 contain the source tree.
</para>

<para>
 Then, in either case, to build from unpacked tarball or CVS source:
</para>

<para>
 <screen>
 autoheader
 autoconf
 ./configure      # (--help to see options)
 make             # (the make from gnu, gmake for *BSD) 
 su 
 make -n install  # (to see where all the files will go)
 make install     # (to really install)
 </screen>
</para>

<para>
  If you have gnu make, you can have the first four steps 
  automatically done for you by just typing
</para>

<para>
 <screen>
  make
 </screen>
</para>

<para>
  in the freshly downloaded or unpacked source directory.
</para>

<para>
 Redhat and SuSE src and binary RPMs can be built with 
 <quote><command>make redhat-dist</command></quote> or
 <quote><command>make suse-dist</command></quote> from unpacked sources. You
 will need to run <quote><command>autoconf; autoheader;
 ./configure</command></quote> beforehand. *BSD will require gmake (from
 <ulink url="http://www.gnu.org">http://www.gnu.org</ulink>).

 <para>

  as well.
