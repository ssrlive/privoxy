 This README is included with the development version of Privoxy, which will
 eventually become Privoxy v3.0 (and soon we hope!). See
 http://www.privoxy.org/. The current code level is BETA, and seems stable to
 us :)

 IMPORTANT CHANGES
------------------</LiteralLayout>
</para>
<para>
 NEWS! As of 03/24/02, the name of this project has been changed from
 ijbswa/Junkbuster to Privoxy. This is reflected in many of the included
 files. 
</para>
<para>
 WARNING! If upgrading from earlier versions of this project via RPM packages,
 the new package will delete any previously installed 'Junkbuster' packages.
</para>
<para>
 IMPORTANT! READ! Configuration Change as of 3 Apr 2002: The default listening
 port is now 8118 due to conflicts with port 8000 assignment. You will need to
 change your browser if upgrading!!! And maybe firewall, etc.
</para>

<para>
 <LiteralLayout>

 INSTALL
--------</LiteralLayout>
</para>
<para>
 For tarball, first unpack:
</para>

<programlisting>
 tar xzvf privoxy-2.9.13-beta-src.tar.gz
 cd privoxy-2.9.13-beta
</programlisting>

<programlisting>
 autoheader
 autoconf
 ./configure	(--help to see options)
 gmake        	(the make from gnu) 
 su 
 make -n install	(to see where all the files will go)
 make install		(to really install)
</programlisting>

<para>
 Redhat and SuSE src and binary RPMs can be built with 'make redhat-dist' or
 'make suse-dist' (run ./configure first) from unpacked sources. BSD will
 (probably?) require gmake (from http://gnu.org). See the user-manual for OS/2
 build instructions.
</para>
<para>
 Privoxy is also available via anonymous CVS:
</para>

<programlisting>
 cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.ijbswa.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/ijbswa login
 cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.ijbswa.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/ijbswa co current
</programlisting>
<para>
 This will create a directory named 'current'. Then, 'cd current', and then
 build as above.
</para>

<para>
 <LiteralLayout>

 RUN
---- </LiteralLayout>
</para>

<para>
 privoxy [--help] [--version] [--no-daemon] [--pidfile PIDFILE] 
  [--user USER[.GROUP]] [config_file]
</para>
<para>
See the man page or user-manual for a brief explanation of each option.
</para>
<para>
 If no config_file is specified on the command line, Privoxy will look for a
 file named 'config' in the current directory (except Win32 which will look
 for 'config.txt'). If no config_file is found, Privoxy will fail to start.
</para>
<para>
 Or for Red Hat: /etc/rc.d/init.d/privoxy start
</para>
<para>
 Or for SuSE:   /etc/rc.d/privoxy start
</para>

<para>
 <LiteralLayout>

 CONFIGURATION
-------------- </LiteralLayout>
</para>
<para>
 See: 'config', 'default.action', and 'default.filter'. There are several
 actions files included. These are all well commented. Most of the magic is in
 '*.action', and there are several of these included with varying degrees of
 aggressiveness. On Unix-like systems, these files are installed in
 /etc/privoxy.  On Windows, then wherever the executable itself is installed.
 There are many significant changes and advances since Junkbuster v2.0.x. The
 user-manual has a run down of configuration options, and examples:
 http://www.privoxy.org/user-manual/.
</para>
<para>
 Be sure to set your browser(s) for HTTP/HTTPS Proxy at &lt;IP&gt;:&lt;Port&gt;, or
 whatever you specify in the config file under 'listen-address'. DEFAULT is
 localhost:8118.
</para>
<para>
 The default.action file can be configured via the web interface accessed via
 http://p.p/, as well other options.
</para>
<para>
 All configuration files are subject to unannounced changes during the
 development process.
</para>

<para>
 <LiteralLayout>

 DOCUMENTATION
--------------</LiteralLayout>
 There is a growing amount of documentation in the 'doc' subdirectory, but it
 is not completed at this point. In particular, see the user-manual there, the
 faq, and developers should look at developer-manual.
</para>
<para>
 The most up to date source of information on the current development version,
 may still be either comments in the source code, or the included
 configuration files, which are all well commented. These are 'config',
 '*.action', and 'default.filter' in the toplevel source directory.
</para>

<para>
 Included documentation may vary according to platform and packager.
</para>

   Make sure that the bug has not already been submitted. Please try
   to verify that it is a Privoxy bug, and not a browser or site
   bug first. If you are using your own custom configuration, please
   try the stock configs to see if the problem is a configuration
   related bug. And if not using the latest development snapshot,
   please try the latest one. Or even better, CVS sources. Please 
   be sure to include the Privoxy/Junkbuster version, platform, 
   browser, any pertinent log data, any other relevant details 
   (please be specific) and, if possible, some way to reproduce the 
   bug.
