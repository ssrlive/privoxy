 READ: Document Note: This file generates the README in the top level 
 source directory. It is generated as only a plain text file. The 
 current markup is not suitable for other formats. Build from 
 Makefile with 'make dok-readme'.

 READ:

 ======================================================================
 NOTE: The left margin spacing is *important* when using 'literallayout'
 WYSISWYG!!! Don't mess this up!!! Careful with linebreaks too, ie 
 the para tag forces a linebreak. Tags need to be carefully placed as a result
 to avoid extra blank lines, etc.

 Privoxy &p-version;<![%p-not-stable;[, which will eventually become Privoxy v3.2]]><![%p-beta;[ (and soon we hope!)]]>. 
 See http://www.privoxy.org/ for more information. The current code
 level is &p-status;<![%p-beta;[, but seems stable to us :)]]><![%p-alpha;[,
 and may break in mysterious ways :) There may be features only partially 
 implemented, or worse, not functional. If you are interested in participating

<para>
 NEWS! As of 03/24/02, the name of this project has been changed from
 ijbswa/Junkbuster to Privoxy. This is reflected in many of the included
 files. 
</para>
<para>
 WARNING! If upgrading from earlier versions of this project via RPM packages,
 the new package will delete any previously installed 'Junkbuster' packages.
</para>
<para>
 IMPORTANT! READ! Configuration Change as of 17 Mar 2002: The default listening
 port is now 8118 due to conflicts with port 8000 assignment. You will need to
 change your browser if upgrading!!! And maybe firewall, etc.

<para>
 See the man page or User Manual for an explanation of each option, and 
 other configuration and usage issues.
</para>
<para>
 If no config_file is specified on the command line, Privoxy will look for a
 file named 'config' in the current directory (except Win32 which will look
 for 'config.txt'). If no config_file is found, Privoxy will fail to start.

<sect1 id="configuration"><title>CONFIGURATION</title>
<para>
 See: 'config', 'default.action', 'user.action', and 'default.filter'.
 'user.action' is for personal and local configuration preferences. These are
 all well commented. Most of the magic is in '*.action' files. 'user.action'
 should be used for any actions customizations. On Unix-like systems, these
 files are installed in /etc/privoxy.  On Windows, then wherever the
 executable itself is installed. There are many significant changes and
 advances since Junkbuster v2.0.x. The User Manual has an explanation of
 all configuration options, and examples: http://www.privoxy.org/user-manual/.
</para>
<para>
 Be sure to set your browser(s) for HTTP/HTTPS Proxy at &lt;IP&gt;:&lt;Port&gt;, or
 whatever you specify in the config file under 'listen-address'. DEFAULT is
 localhost:8118. Note that Privoxy ONLY proxies HTTP (and HTTPS) traffic. Do not try it 
 with FTP or other protocols for the simple reason it does not work.
</para>
<para>
 The actions list can be configured via the web interface accessed via
 http://p.p/, as well other options.
</para>

 development process.

<sect1 id="documentation"><title>DOCUMENTATION</title>
<para>
 There should be documentation in the 'doc' subdirectory<![%p-not-stable;[, but it
 may not be in sync with current code]]>. In particular, see the User Manual there,
 the FAQ, and those interested in Privoxy development, should look at
 developer-manual. 
</para>
<para>
 <![%p-not-stable;[
 The most up to date source of information on the current development version,
 may  be either comments in the source code, or the included
 configuration files. ]]>The source and configuration files are all well
 commented. The main configuration files are: 'config', 'default.action', and
 'default.filter'<![%p-not-stable;[ in the toplevel source directory]]>.
