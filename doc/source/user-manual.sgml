<title>Note to Upgraders</title>
<para>
 There are very significant changes from older versions of 
 <application>Junkbuster</application> to the current
 <application>Privoxy</application>. Configuration is substantially 
 changed. <application>Junkbuster 2.0.x</application> and earlier 
 configuration files will not migrate. The functionality of the old
 <filename>blockfile</filename>, <filename>cookiefile</filename> and
 <filename>imagelist</filename>, are now combined into the
 <quote>actions file</quote>  (<filename>default.action</filename>
 for most installations).
</para>
<para>
 A <quote>filter file</quote> (typically <filename>default.filter</filename>)
 is new as of <application>Privoxy 2.9.x</application>, and provides some
 of the new sophistication (explained below). <filename>config</filename> is 
 much the same as before.
</para>
<para>
 If upgrading from a 2.0.x version, you will have to use the new config 
 files, and possibly adapt any personal rules from your older files.
 When porting personal rules over from the old <filename>blockfile</filename>
 to the new actions file, please note that even the pattern syntax has
 changed. If upgrading from 2.9.x development versions, it is still
 recommended to use the new configuration files.
</para>

<!--   ~~~~~       New section      ~~~~~     -->
<sect2 id="startup">
<title>Starting <application>Privoxy</application></title>
<para>
 Before launching <application>Privoxy</application> for the first time, you 
 will want to configure your browser(s) to use <application>Privoxy</application>
 as a HTTP and HTTPS proxy. The default is localhost for the proxy address,
 and port 8118 (earlier versions used port 8000). This is the one required 
 configuration that must be done! 
</para>
 
<para> 
 With <application>Netscape</application> (and
 <application>Mozilla</application>), this can be set under <literal>Edit
 -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Proxies -&gt; HTTP Proxy</literal>.
 For <application>Internet Explorer</application>: <literal>Tools -&gt;
 Internet Properties -&gt; Connections -&gt; LAN Setting</literal>. Then,
 check <quote>Use Proxy</quote> and fill in the appropriate info (Address:
 localhost, Port: 8118). Include if HTTPS proxy support too.
</para>

<para>
 After doing this, flush your browser's disk and memory caches to force a
 re-reading of all pages and to get rid of any ads that may be cached. You 
 are now ready to start enjoying the benefits of using
 <application>Privoxy</application>!
</para>


<para>
 <application>Privoxy</application> is typically started by specifying the
 main configuration file to be used on the command line. Example Unix startup
 command:
</para>

<para>
 <screen>
 
 # /usr/sbin/privoxy /etc/privoxy/config
 
 </screen>
</para>

<para>
 See <link linkend="cmdoptions">below</link> for other command line options.
</para>

<para>
 An init script is provided for SuSE and Red Hat.
</para>

<para>
 For for SuSE: <command>rcprivoxy start</command>
</para>

<para>
 For Red Hat: <command>/etc/rc.d/init.d/privoxy start</command>
</para>


<para>
 If no configuration file is specified on the command line,
 <application>Privoxy</application> will look for a file named
 <filename>config</filename> in the current directory. Except on Win32 where
 it will try <filename>config.txt</filename>. If no file is specified on the
 command line and no default configuration file can be found, 
 <application>Privoxy</application> will fail to start.
</para>


<para>
 The included default configuration files should give a reasonable starting
 point. Most of the per site configuration is done in the
 <quote>actions</quote> files. These are where various cookie actions are
 defined, ad and banner blocking, and other aspects of
 <application>Privoxy</application> configuration. There are several such
 files included, with varying levels of aggressiveness. 
</para>

<para>
 You will probably want to keep an eye out for sites that require persistent
 cookies, and add these to <filename>default.action</filename> as needed. By
 default, most of these will be accepted only during the current browser
 session (aka <quote>session cookies</quote>), until you add them to the
 configuration. If you want the browser to handle this instead, you will need
 to edit <filename>default.action</filename> and disable this feature. If you
 use more than one browser, it would make more sense to let
 <application>Privoxy</application> handle this. In which case, the
 browser(s) should be set to accept all cookies.
</para>

<para>
 Another feature where you will probably want to define exceptions for trusted
 sites is the popup-killing (through the <literal>+popup</literal> and
 <literal>+filter{popups}</literal> actions), because your favorite shopping,
 banking, or leisure site may need popups. 
</para>

<para>
 <application>Privoxy</application> is HTTP/1.1 compliant,  but not all of
 the optional 1.1 features are as yet supported. In the unlikely event that
 you experience inexplicable problems with browsers that use HTTP/1.1 per default
 (like <application>Mozilla</application> or recent versions of I.E.), you might
 try to force HTTP/1.0 compatibility. For Mozilla, look under <literal>Edit -&gt;
 Preferences -&gt; Debug -&gt; Networking</literal>.
 Alternatively, set the <quote>+downgrade</quote> config option in
 <filename>default.action</filename> which will downgrade your browser's HTTP
 requests from HTTP/1.1 to HTTP/1.0 before processing them.
</para>

<para>
 After running <application>Privoxy</application> for a while, you can 
 start to fine tune the configuration to suit your personal, or site, 
 preferences and requirements. There are many, many aspects that can 
 be customized. <quote>Actions</quote> (as specified in <filename>default.action</filename>) 
 can be adjusted by pointing your browser to 
 <ulink url="http://config.privoxy.org/">http://config.privoxy.org/</ulink>
 (shortcut: <ulink url="http://p.p/">http://p.p/</ulink>), 
 and then follow the link to <quote>edit the actions list</quote>. 
 (This is an internal page and does not require Internet access.)
</para>

<para>
 In fact, various aspects of <application>Privoxy</application>
 configuration can be viewed from this page, including 
 current configuration parameters, source code version numbers, 
 the browser's request headers, and <quote>actions</quote> that apply 
 to a given URL. In addition to the <filename>default.action</filename> file 
 editor mentioned above, <application>Privoxy</application> can also 
 be turned <quote>on</quote> and <quote>off</quote> (toggled) from this page.
</para>

<para>
 If you encounter problems, try loading the page without
 <application>Privoxy</application>. If that helps, enter the URL where
 you have the problems into <ulink url="http://p.p/show-url-info">the browser
 based rule tracing utility</ulink>. See which rules apply and why, and
 then try turning them off for that site one after the other, until the problem
 is gone. When you have found the culprit, you might want to turn the rest on
 again.
</para>

<para>
 If the above paragraph sounds gibberish to you, you might want to <ulink
 url="configuration.html#ACTIONSFILE">read more about the actions concept</ulink>
 or even dive deep into the <ulink url="appendix.html#ACTIONSANAT">Appendix
 on actions</ulink>.
</para>

<para>
 If you can't get rid of the problem at all, think you've found a bug in
 Privoxy, want to propose a new feature or smarter rules, please see the 
 chapter "Contacting the Developers, .." below.

<title>Configuration Files Overview</title>
<para>
 For Unix, *BSD and Linux, all configuration files are located in
 <filename>/etc/privoxy/</filename> by default. For MS Windows, OS/2, and
 AmigaOS these are all in the same directory as the 
 <application>Privoxy</application> executable. <![%p-not-stable;[ The name
 and number of configuration files has changed from previous versions, and is
 subject to change as development progresses.]]>
</para>

<para>
 The installed defaults provide a reasonable starting point, though possibly
 aggressive by some standards. For the time being, there are only three
 default configuration files (this may change in time):
</para>

<para>
 <itemizedlist>

  <listitem>
   <para>
     The main configuration file is named <filename>config</filename>
     on Linux, Unix, BSD, OS/2, and AmigaOS and <filename>config.txt</filename>
     on Windows.
   </para>
  </listitem> 

  <listitem>
   <para>
    <filename>default.action</filename> (the actions file) is used to define
    which of a set of various <quote>actions</quote> relating to images, banners, 
    pop-ups, access restrictions, banners and cookies are to be applied, and where.
    There is a web based editor for this file that can be accessed at <ulink
    url="http://config.privoxy.org/edit-actions/">http://config.privoxy.org/edit-actions/</ulink>
    (Shortcut: <ulink url="http://p.p/edit-actions/">http://p.p/edit-actions/</ulink>).
    (Other actions files are included as well with differing levels of filtering 
    and blocking, e.g. <filename>basic.action</filename>.)
   </para>
  </listitem> 

  <listitem>
   <para>
    <filename>default.filter</filename> (the filter file) can be used to re-write the raw
    page content, including viewable text as well as embedded HTML and JavaScript,
    and whatever else lurks on any given web page. The filtering jobs are only
    pre-defined here; whether to apply them or not is up to the actions file.
   </para>
  </listitem> 

 </itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>
 All files use the <quote><literal>#</literal></quote> character to denote a
 comment (the rest of the line will be ignored) and understand line continuation
 through placing a backslash ("<literal>\</literal>") as the very last character
 in a line. If the <literal>#</literal> is preceded by a backslash, it looses
 its special function. Placing a <literal>#</literal> in front of an otherwise
 valid configuration line to prevent it from being interpreted is called "commenting
 out" that line.
</para>

<para>
 <filename>default.action</filename> and <filename>default.filter</filename> 
 can use Perl style <link linkend="regex">regular expressions</link> for
 maximum flexibility. 
</para>

<para>
 After making any changes, there is no need to restart

<sect2>
<title>The Main Configuration File</title>
<para>
 Again, the main configuration file is named <filename>config</filename> on
 Linux/Unix/BSD and OS/2, and <filename>config.txt</filename> on Windows.
 Configuration lines consist of an initial keyword followed by a list of
 values, all separated by whitespace (any number of spaces or tabs). For
 example:
</para>

<para>
 <literal>
  <msgtext> 
   <literallayout>
  <emphasis>confdir /etc/privoxy</emphasis>
   </literallayout>
  </msgtext>
 </literal> 
</para>

<para>
 Assigns the value <literal>/etc/privoxy</literal> to the option
 <literal>confdir</literal> and thus indicates that the configuration
 directory is named <quote>/etc/privoxy/</quote>.
</para>

<para>
 All options in the config file except for <literal>confdir</literal> and
 <literal>logdir</literal> are optional. Watch out in the below description
 for what happens if you leave them unset.
</para>

<para>
 The main config file controls all aspects of <application>Privoxy</application>'s
 operation that are not location dependent (i.e. they apply universally, no matter
 where you may be surfing).

 <application>Privoxy</application> can (and normally does) use a number of
 other files for additional configuration and logging.

 where to find those other files.

<title>Forwarding</title>

<para>
 This feature allows routing of HTTP requests through a chain of
 multiple proxies.
 It can be used to better protect privacy and confidentiality when
 accessing specific domains by routing requests to those domains
 through an anonymous public proxy (see e.g. <ulink
 url="http://www.multiproxy.org/anon_list.htm">http://www.multiproxy.org/anon_list.htm</ulink>)
 Or to use a caching proxy to speed up browsing. Or chaining to a parent
 proxy may be necessary because the machine that <application>Privoxy</application>
 runs on has no direct Internet access.
</para>

<sect4><title>Advanced Forwarding Examples</title>

<para>
 If you have links to multiple ISPs that provide various special content 
 only to their subscribers, you can configure multiple <application>Privoxies</application>
 which have connections to the respective ISPs to act as forwarders to each other, so that
 <emphasis>your</emphasis> users can see the internal content of all ISPs.
</para>

<para>
 Assume that host-a has a PPP connection to isp-a.net. And host-b has a PPP connection to
 isp-b.net. Both run <application>Privoxy</application>. Their forwarding
 configuration can look like this:
</para>

<para>
 host-a:
</para>

<para>
 <screen>
  forward    .*.         .
  forward    .isp-b.net  host-b:8118
 </screen>
</para>

<para>
 host-b:
</para>

<para>
 <screen>
  forward    .*.         .
  forward    .isp-a.net  host-a:8118
 </screen>
</para>

<para>
 Now, your users can set their browser's proxy to use either
 host-a or host-b and be able to browse the internal content
 of both isp-a and isp-b.
</para>

<para>
 If you intend to chain <application>Privoxy</application> and 
 <application>squid</application> locally, then chain as 
 <literal>browser -> squid -> privoxy</literal> is the recommended way. 
</para>

<para>
 Assuming that <application>Privoxy</application> and <application>squid</application>
 run on the same box, your squid configuration could then look like this:
</para>

<para>
 <screen>
  # Define Privoxy as parent proxy (without ICP) 
  cache_peer 127.0.0.1 parent 8118 7 no-query 

  # Define ACL for protocol FTP 
  acl ftp proto FTP 

  # Do not forward FTP requests to Privoxy
  always_direct allow ftp 

  # Forward all the rest to Privoxy
  never_direct allow all 
 </screen>
</para>

<para>
 You would then need to change your browser's proxy settings to <application>squid</application>'s address and port.
 Squid normally uses port 3128. If unsure consult <literal>http_port</literal> in <filename>squid.conf</filename>.

 accepted only during the current browser session (i.e. not written to disk),
 content can be modified, JavaScripts tamed, user-tracking fooled, and much more.
 See below for a complete list of available actions.
</para>

<para>
 An actions file typically has sections. At the top, <quote>aliases</quote> are 
 defined (discussed below), then the default set of rules which will apply 
 universally to all sites and pages. And then below that is generally a lengthy 
 set of exceptions to the defined universal policies.
</para>

<sect3>
<title>Finding the Right Mix</title>
<para>
 Note that some actions like cookie suppression or script disabling may
 render some sites unusable, which rely on these techniques to work properly.
 Finding the right mix of actions is not easy and certainly a matter of personal
 taste. In general, it can be said that the more <quote>aggressive</quote>
 your default settings (in the top section of the actions file) are,
 the more exceptions for <quote>trusted</quote> sites you will have to
 make later. If, for example, you want to kill popup windows per default, you'll
 have to make exceptions from that rule for sites that you regularly use
 and that require popups for actually useful content, like maybe your bank,
 favorite shop, or newspaper.
</para>

<para>
 We have tried to provide you with reasonable rules to start from in the
 distribution actions file. But there is no general rule of thumb on these
 things. There just are too many variables, and sites are constantly changing.
 Sooner or later you will want to change the rules (and read this chapter).

<title>How to Edit</title>
<para>
 The easiest way to edit the <quote>actions</quote> file is with a browser by
 using our browser-based editor, which is available at <ulink
 url="http://config.privoxy.org/edit-actions">http://config.privoxy.org/edit-actions</ulink>.
</para>

<para>
 If you prefer plain text editing to GUIs, you can of course also directly edit the
 <filename>default.action</filename> file.
</para>
</sect3>


<sect3>
<title>How Actions are Applied to URLs</title>
<para>
 The actions file is divided into sections. There are special sections,
 like the alias sections which will be discussed later. For now let's
 concentrate on regular sections: They have a heading line (often split
 up to multiple lines for readability) which consist of a list of actions,
 separated by whitespace and enclosed in curly braces. Below that, there
 is a list of URL patterns, each on a separate line.
</para>

<para>
 To determine which actions apply to a request, the URL of the request is
 compared to all patterns in this file. Every time it matches, the list of
 applicable actions for the URL is incrementally updated, using the heading
 of the section in which the pattern is located. If multiple matches for
 the same URL set the same action differently, the last match wins.
</para>

<para>
 You can trace this process by visiting <ulink
 url="http://config.privoxy.org/show-url-info">http://config.privoxy.org/show-url-info</ulink>.
</para>

<para>
 More detail on this is provided in the Appendix, <link linkend="ACTIONSANAT">
 Anatomy of an Action</link>.

<sect3>
<title>Patterns</title>
<para>
 Generally, a pattern has the form <literal>&lt;domain&gt;/&lt;path&gt;</literal>,
 where both the <literal>&lt;domain&gt;</literal> and <literal>&lt;path&gt;</literal>
 are optional. (This is why the pattern <literal>/</literal> matches all URLs).
</para>

<variablelist>
 <varlistentry>
  <term><literal>www.example.com/</literal></term>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    is a domain-only pattern and will match any request to <literal>www.example.com</literal>,
    regardless of which document on that server is requested.
   </para>
  </listitem>
 </varlistentry>
 <varlistentry>
  <term><literal>www.example.com</literal></term>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    means exactly the same. For domain-only patterns, the trailing <literal>/</literal> may
    be omitted.
   </para>
  </listitem>
 </varlistentry>
 <varlistentry>
  <term><literal>www.example.com/index.html</literal></term>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    matches only the single document <literal>/index.html</literal>
    on <literal>www.example.com</literal>.
   </para>
  </listitem>
 </varlistentry>
 <varlistentry>
  <term><literal>/index.html</literal></term>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    matches the document <literal>/index.html</literal>, regardless of the domain,
    i.e. on <emphasis>any</emphasis> web server.
   </para>
  </listitem>
 </varlistentry>
 <varlistentry>
  <term><literal>index.html</literal></term>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    matches nothing, since it would be  interpreted as a domain name and
    there is no top-level domain called <literal>.html</literal>.
   </para>
  </listitem>
 </varlistentry>
</variablelist>

<sect4><title>The Domain Pattern</title>

<para>
 The matching of the domain part offers some flexible options: if the
 domain starts or ends with a dot, it becomes unanchored at that end. 
 For example:
</para>

<variablelist>
 <varlistentry>
  <term><literal>.example.com</literal></term>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    matches any domain that <emphasis>ENDS</emphasis> in
    <literal>.example.com</literal>
   </para>
  </listitem>
 </varlistentry>
 <varlistentry>
  <term><literal>www.</literal></term>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    matches any domain that <emphasis>STARTS</emphasis> with
    <literal>www.</literal>
   </para>
  </listitem>
 </varlistentry>
 <varlistentry>
  <term><literal>.example.</literal></term>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    matches any domain that <emphasis>CONTAINS</emphasis> <literal>.example.</literal>
    (Correctly speaking: It matches any FQDN that contains <literal>example</literal> as a domain.)
   </para>
  </listitem>
 </varlistentry>
</variablelist>

<para>
 Additionally, there are wild-cards that you can use in the domain names
 themselves. They work pretty similar to shell wild-cards: <quote>*</quote>
 stands for zero or more arbitrary characters, <quote>?</quote> stands for
 any single character, you can define character classes in square
 brackets and all of that can be freely mixed:
</para>

<variablelist>
 <varlistentry>
  <term><literal>ad*.example.com</literal></term>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    matches <quote>adserver.example.com</quote>, 
    <quote>ads.example.com</quote>, etc but not <quote>sfads.example.com</quote>
   </para>
  </listitem>
 </varlistentry>
 <varlistentry>
  <term><literal>*ad*.example.com</literal></term>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    matches all of the above, and then some.
   </para>
  </listitem>
 </varlistentry>
 <varlistentry>
  <term><literal>.?pix.com</literal></term>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    matches <literal>www.ipix.com</literal>,
    <literal>pictures.epix.com</literal>, <literal>a.b.c.d.e.upix.com</literal> etc. 
   </para>
  </listitem>
 </varlistentry>
 <varlistentry>
  <term><literal>www[1-9a-ez].example.c*</literal></term>
  <listitem>
   <para>
     matches <literal>www1.example.com</literal>, 
     <literal>www4.example.cc</literal>, <literal>wwwd.example.cy</literal>, 
     <literal>wwwz.example.com</literal> etc., but <emphasis>not</emphasis> 
     <literal>wwww.example.com</literal>.

<sect4><title>The Path Pattern</title>

<para>
 <application>Privoxy</application> uses Perl compatible regular expressions
 (through the <ulink url="http://www.pcre.org/">PCRE</ulink> library) for
 matching the path.
</para>

<para>
 There is an <link linkend="regex">Appendix</link> with a brief quick-start into regular
 expressions, and full (very technical) documentation on PCRE regex syntax is available on-line
 at <ulink url="http://www.pcre.org/man.txt">http://www.pcre.org/man.txt</ulink>.
 You might also find the Perl man page on regular expressions (<literal>man perlre</literal>)
 useful, which is available on-line at <ulink
 url="http://www.perldoc.com/perl5.6/pod/perlre.html">http://www.perldoc.com/perl5.6/pod/perlre.html</ulink>.
</para>

<para>
 Note that the path pattern is automatically left-anchored at the <quote>/</quote>,
 i.e. it matches as if it would start with a <quote>^</quote>.
</para>

<para>
 Please also note that matching in the path is case
 <emphasis>INSENSITIVE</emphasis> by default, but you can switch to case
 sensitive at any point in the pattern by using the 
 <quote>(?-i)</quote> switch:
 <literal>www.example.com/(?-i)PaTtErN.*</literal> will match only
 documents whose path starts with <literal>PaTtErN</literal> in
 <emphasis>exactly</emphasis> this capitalization.

<title>Actions</title>
<para>
 Actions are enabled if preceded with a <quote>+</quote>, and disabled if 
 preceded with a <quote>-</quote>. Actions are invoked by enclosing the 
 action name in curly braces (e.g. {+some_action}), followed by a list of 
 URLs (or patterns that match URLs) to which the action applies. There are
 three classes of actions: 
</para>

<para>
 <itemizedlist>

 <listitem>
  <para>  
   Boolean, i.e the action can only be <quote>on</quote> or
   <quote>off</quote>. Examples: 
 </para>
  <para>
   <literal>
    <msgtext> 
     <literallayout>
  <emphasis>{+name}</emphasis>        # enable this action
  <emphasis>{-name}</emphasis>        # disable this action
     </literallayout>
    </msgtext> 
   </literal>
  </para>
 </listitem>


 <listitem>
  <para>  
   Parameterized, e.g. <quote>+/-hide-user-agent{ Mozilla 1.0 }</quote>, 
   where some value is required in order to enable this type of action.
   Examples:
  </para>
  <para>
   <literal>
    <msgtext> 
     <literallayout>
  <emphasis>{+name{param}}</emphasis>  # enable action and set parameter to <quote>param</quote>
  <emphasis>{-name}</emphasis>         # disable action (<quote>parameter</quote>) can be omitted

  </para>
 </listitem>

   Multi-value, e.g. <quote>{+/-add-header{Name: value}}</quote> ot
   <quote>{+/-wafer{name=value}}</quote>), where some value needs to be defined
   in addition to simply enabling the actino. Examples:
  </para>
  <para>
   <literal>
    <msgtext> 
     <literallayout>
  <emphasis>{+name{param=value}}</emphasis>   # enable action and set <quote>param</quote> to <quote>value</quote>
  <emphasis>{-name{param=value}}</emphasis>   # remove the parameter <quote>param</quote> completely
  <emphasis>{-name}</emphasis>                # disable this action totally and remove <application>param</application> too
     </literallayout>
    </msgtext> 
   </literal>
  </para>
 </listitem>

<para>
 If nothing is specified in this file, no <quote>actions</quote> are taken.
 So in this case <application>Privoxy</application> would just be a
 normal, non-blocking, non-anonymizing proxy. You must specifically
 enable the privacy and blocking features you need (although the 
 provided default <filename>default.action</filename> file will 
 give a good starting point).
</para>

<para>
 Later defined actions always over-ride earlier ones.  So exceptions 
 to any rules you make, should come in the latter part of the file. For
 multi-valued actions, the actions are applied in the order they are
 specified.

    is used as the replacement. If <quote>last</quote> is given, the last

    Many sites, like yahoo.com, don't just link to other sites. Instead, they
    will link to some script on their own server, giving the destination as a
    parameter, which will then redirect you to the final target. URLs
    resulting from this scheme typically look like:
    <emphasis>http://some.place/some_script?http://some.where-else</emphasis>.
  </para>
   <para>
    Sometimes, there are even multiple consecutive redirects encoded in the
    URL. These redirections via scripts make your web browsing more traceable,
    since the server from which you follow such a link can see where you go
    to. Apart from that, valuable bandwidth and time is wasted, while your
    browser ask the server for one redirect after the other. Plus, it feeds
    the advertisers.

    Filtering requires buffering the page content, which may appear to
    slow down page rendering since nothing is displayed until all content has
    passed the filters. (It does not really take longer, but seems that way
    since the page is not incrementally displayed.) This effect will be more
    noticeable on slower connections.

    The CONNECT methods exists in HTTP to allow access to secure websites
    (https:// URLs) through proxies. It works very simply: the proxy connects
    to the server on the specified port, and then short-circuits its
    connections to the client <emphasis>and</emphasis> to the remote proxy.
    This can be a big security hole, since CONNECT-enabled proxies can be
    abused as TCP relays very easily.

   If you want to allow CONNECT for more ports than this, or want to forbid

 These can in turn be invoked just like the built-in <quote>actions</quote>.

 <quote>{</quote> or <quote>}</quote>. But please use only <quote>a</quote>-
 <quote>z</quote>, <quote>0</quote>-<quote>9</quote>, <quote>+</quote>, and
 <quote>-</quote>. Alias names are not case sensitive, and 
 <emphasis>must be defined  before anything</emphasis> else in the

<title>Regular Expressions</title>
<para>
 <application>Privoxy</application> can use <quote>regular expressions</quote> 
 in various config files. Assuming support for <quote>pcre</quote> (Perl
 Compatible Regular Expressions) is compiled in, which is the default. Such
 configuration directives do not require regular expressions, but they can be
 used to increase flexibility by matching a pattern with wild-cards against
 URLs.
</para>

<para>
 If you are reading this, you probably don't understand what <quote>regular
 expressions</quote> are, or what they can do. So this will be a very brief
 introduction only. A full explanation would require a book ;-)
</para>

<para>
 <quote>Regular expressions</quote> is a way of matching one character
 expression against another to see if it matches or not. One of the
 <quote>expressions</quote> is a literal string of readable characters
 (letter, numbers, etc), and the other is a complex string of literal
 characters combined with wild-cards, and other special characters, called
 meta-characters. The <quote>meta-characters</quote> have special meanings and
 are used to build the complex pattern to be matched against. Perl Compatible
 Regular Expressions is an enhanced form of the regular expression language
 with backward compatibility.
</para>

<para>
 To make a simple analogy, we do something similar when we use wild-card
 characters when listing files with the <command>dir</command> command in DOS. 
 <literal>*.*</literal> matches all filenames. The <quote>special</quote>
 character here is the asterisk which matches any and all characters. We can be
 more specific and use <literal>?</literal> to match just individual
 characters. So <quote>dir file?.text</quote> would match
 <quote>file1.txt</quote>, <quote>file2.txt</quote>, etc. We are pattern
 matching, using a similar technique to <quote>regular expressions</quote>!
</para>

<para>
 Regular expressions do essentially the same thing, but are much, much more
 powerful. There are many more <quote>special characters</quote> and ways of 
 building complex patterns however. Let's look at a few of the common ones,
 and then some examples:
</para>

<para><simplelist>
 <member>
  <emphasis>.</emphasis> - Matches any single character, e.g. <quote>a</quote>,
  <quote>A</quote>, <quote>4</quote>, <quote>:</quote>, or <quote>@</quote>.
 </member>
</simplelist></para>

<para><simplelist>
 <member>
  <emphasis>?</emphasis> - The preceding character or expression is matched ZERO or ONE
  times. Either/or.
 </member>
</simplelist></para>

<para><simplelist>
 <member>
  <emphasis>+</emphasis> - The preceding character or expression is matched ONE or MORE
  times.
 </member>
</simplelist></para>

<para><simplelist>
 <member>
  <emphasis>*</emphasis> - The preceding character or expression is matched ZERO or MORE
  times.
 </member>
</simplelist></para>

<para><simplelist>
 <member>
  <emphasis>\</emphasis> - The <quote>escape</quote> character denotes that
  the following character should be taken literally. This is used where one of the 
  special characters (e.g. <quote>.</quote>) needs to be taken literally and
  not as a special meta-character. Example: <quote>example\.com</quote>, makes 
  sure the period is recognized only as a period (and not expanded to its 
  metacharacter meaning of any single character).
 </member>
</simplelist></para>

<para><simplelist>
 <member>
  <emphasis>[]</emphasis> - Characters enclosed in brackets will be matched if
  any of the enclosed characters are encountered. For instance, <quote>[0-9]</quote>
  matches any numeric digit (zero through nine). As an example, we can combine 
  this with <quote>+</quote> to match any digit one of more times: <quote>[0-9]+</quote>.
 </member>
</simplelist></para>

<para><simplelist>
 <member>
  <emphasis>()</emphasis> - parentheses are used to group a sub-expression,
  or multiple sub-expressions.
 </member>
</simplelist></para>

<para><simplelist>
 <member>
  <emphasis>|</emphasis> - The <quote>bar</quote> character works like an
  <quote>or</quote> conditional statement. A match is successful if the
  sub-expression on either side of <quote>|</quote> matches. As an example:
  <quote>/(this|that) example/</quote> uses grouping and the bar character 
  and would match either <quote>this example</quote> or <quote>that
  example</quote>, and nothing else.
 </member>
</simplelist></para>

<para><simplelist>
 <member>
  <emphasis>s/string1/string2/g</emphasis> - This is used to rewrite strings of text. 
  <quote>string1</quote> is replaced by <quote>string2</quote> in this
  example. There must of course be a match on <quote>string1</quote> first.
 </member>
</simplelist></para>

<para>
 These are just some of the ones you are likely to use when matching URLs with 
 <application>Privoxy</application>, and is a long way from a definitive
 list. This is enough to get us started with a few simple examples which may
 be more illuminating:
</para>

<para>
 <emphasis><literal>/.*/banners/.*</literal></emphasis> - A  simple example
 that uses the common combination of <quote>.</quote> and <quote>*</quote> to 
 denote any character, zero or more times. In other words, any string at all.
 So we start with a literal forward slash, then our regular expression pattern 
 (<quote>.*</quote>) another literal forward slash, the string
 <quote>banners</quote>, another forward slash, and lastly another
 <quote>.*</quote>. We are building 
 a directory path here. This will match any file with the path that has a
 directory named <quote>banners</quote> in it. The <quote>.*</quote> matches
 any characters, and this could conceivably be more forward slashes, so it
 might expand into a much longer looking path. For example, this could match:
 <quote>/eye/hate/spammers/banners/annoy_me_please.gif</quote>, or just
 <quote>/banners/annoying.html</quote>, or almost an infinite number of other
 possible combinations, just so it has <quote>banners</quote> in the path
 somewhere.
</para>

<para>
 A now something a little more complex:
</para>

<para>
 <emphasis><literal>/.*/adv((er)?ts?|ertis(ing|ements?))?/</literal></emphasis> - 
 We have several literal forward slashes again (<quote>/</quote>), so we are
 building another expression that is a file path statement. We have another 
 <quote>.*</quote>, so we are matching against any conceivable sub-path, just so
 it matches our expression. The only true literal that <emphasis>must
 match</emphasis> our pattern is <application>adv</application>, together with
 the forward slashes. What comes after the <quote>adv</quote> string is the
 interesting part. 
</para>

<para>
 Remember the <quote>?</quote> means the preceding expression (either a
 literal character or anything grouped with <quote>(...)</quote> in this case)
 can exist or not, since this means either zero or one match. So
 <quote>((er)?ts?|ertis(ing|ements?))</quote> is optional, as are the
 individual sub-expressions: <quote>(er)</quote>,
 <quote>(ing|ements?)</quote>, and the <quote>s</quote>. The <quote>|</quote>
 means <quote>or</quote>. We have two of those. For instance, 
 <quote>(ing|ements?)</quote>, can expand to match either <quote>ing</quote> 
 <emphasis>OR</emphasis> <quote>ements?</quote>. What is being done here, is an
 attempt at matching as many variations of <quote>advertisement</quote>, and 
 similar, as possible. So this would expand to match just <quote>adv</quote>,
 or <quote>advert</quote>, or <quote>adverts</quote>, or
 <quote>advertising</quote>, or <quote>advertisement</quote>, or
 <quote>advertisements</quote>. You get the idea. But it would not match 
 <quote>advertizements</quote> (with a <quote>z</quote>). We could fix that by
 changing our regular expression to: 
 <quote>/.*/adv((er)?ts?|erti(s|z)(ing|ements?))?/</quote>, which would then match
 either spelling.
</para>

<para>
 <emphasis><literal>/.*/advert[0-9]+\.(gif|jpe?g)</literal></emphasis> - Again 
 another path statement with forward slashes. Anything in the square brackets 
 <quote>[]</quote> can be matched. This is using <quote>0-9</quote> as a
 shorthand expression to mean any digit one through nine. It is the same as
 saying <quote>0123456789</quote>. So any digit matches. The <quote>+</quote>
 means one or more of the preceding expression must be included. The preceding 
 expression here is what is in the square brackets -- in this case, any digit 
 one through nine. Then, at the end, we have a grouping: <quote>(gif|jpe?g)</quote>. 
 This includes a <quote>|</quote>, so this needs to match the expression on
 either side of that bar character also. A simple <quote>gif</quote> on one side, and the other
 side will in turn match either <quote>jpeg</quote> or <quote>jpg</quote>,
 since the <quote>?</quote> means the letter <quote>e</quote> is optional and
 can be matched once or not at all. So we are building an expression here to
 match image GIF or JPEG type image file. It must include the literal
 string <quote>advert</quote>, then one or more digits, and a <quote>.</quote>
 (which is now a literal, and not a special character, since it is escaped
 with <quote>\</quote>), and lastly either <quote>gif</quote>, or
 <quote>jpeg</quote>, or <quote>jpg</quote>. Some possible matches would
 include: <quote>//advert1.jpg</quote>,
 <quote>/nasty/ads/advert1234.gif</quote>,
 <quote>/banners/from/hell/advert99.jpg</quote>. It would not match
 <quote>advert1.gif</quote> (no leading slash), or
 <quote>/adverts232.jpg</quote> (the expression does not include an
 <quote>s</quote>), or <quote>/advert1.jsp</quote> (<quote>jsp</quote> is not
 in the expression anywhere).
</para>

<para>
 <emphasis><literal>s/microsoft(?!.com)/MicroSuck/i</literal></emphasis> - This is 
 a substitution. <quote>MicroSuck</quote> will replace any occurrence of 
 <quote>microsoft</quote>.  The <quote>i</quote> at the end of the expression
 means ignore case. The <quote>(?!.com)</quote> means 
 the match should fail if <quote>microsoft</quote> is followed by
 <quote>.com</quote>. In other words, this acts like a <quote>NOT</quote>
 modifier. In case this is a hyperlink, we don't want to break it ;-).
</para>

<para>
 We are barely scratching the surface of regular expressions here so that you
 can understand the default <application>Privoxy</application>
 configuration files, and maybe use this knowledge to customize your own
 installation. There is much, much more that can be done with regular
 expressions. Now that you know enough to get started, you can learn more on
 your own :/

 Below are some <quote>bookmarklets</quote> to allow you to easily access a
 <quote>mini</quote> version of some of <application>Privoxy's</application>
 special pages. They are designed for MS Internet Explorer, but should work
 equally well in Netscape, Mozilla, and other browsers which support
 JavaScript. They are designed to run directly from your bookmarks - not by
 clicking the links below (although that should work for testing).
</para>
<para>
 To save them, right-click the link and choose <quote>Add to Favorites</quote>
 (IE) or <quote>Add Bookmark</quote> (Netscape). You will get a warning that
 the bookmark <quote>may not be safe</quote> - just click OK. Then you can run the
 Bookmarklet directly from your favorites/bookmarks. For even faster access,
 you can put them on the <quote>Links</quote> bar (IE) or the <quote>Personal
 Toolbar</quote> (Netscape), and run them with a single click.

<sect2 id="actionsanat">
<title>Anatomy of an Action</title>

<para>
 The way <application>Privoxy</application> applies <quote>actions</quote>
 and <quote>filters</quote> to any given URL can be complex, and not always so
 easy to understand what is happening. And sometimes we need to be able to
 <emphasis>see</emphasis> just what <application>Privoxy</application> is
 doing. Especially, if something <application>Privoxy</application> is doing
 is causing us a problem inadvertently. It can be a little daunting to look at
 the actions and filters files themselves, since they tend to be filled with
 <quote>regular expressions</quote> whose consequences are not always 
 so obvious. 
</para>

<para>
 One quick test to see if <application>Privoxy</application> is causing a problem 
 or not, is to disable it temporarily. This should be the first troubleshooting 
 step. See <link linkend="bookmarklets">the Bookmarklets</link> section on a quick 
 and easy way to do this.
</para>

<para>
 <application>Privoxy</application> also provides the 
 <ulink url="http://config.privoxy.org/show-url-info">http://config.privoxy.org/show-url-info</ulink>
 page that can show us very specifically how <application>actions</application>
 are being applied to any given URL. This is a big help for troubleshooting.
</para>

<para>
 First, enter one URL (or partial URL) at the prompt, and then
 <application>Privoxy</application> will tell us 
 how the current configuration will handle it. This will not
 help with filtering effects from the <filename>default.filter</filename> file! It
 also will not tell you about any other URLs that may be embedded within the
 URL you are testing (i.e. a web page). For instance, images such as ads are expressed as URLs
 within the raw page source of HTML pages. So you will only get info for the
 actual URL that is pasted into the prompt area -- not any sub-URLs. If you
 want to know about embedded URLs like ads, you will have to dig those out of
 the HTML source. Use your browser's <quote>View Page Source</quote> option
 for this. Or right click on the ad, and grab the URL.
</para>

<para>
 Let's look at an example, <ulink url="http://google.com">google.com</ulink>, 
 one section at a time:
</para>

<para>
 <screen>
 System default actions:

 { -add-header -block -deanimate-gifs -downgrade -fast-redirects -filter 
   -hide-forwarded -hide-from -hide-referer -hide-user-agent -image 
   -image-blocker -limit-connect -no-compression -no-cookies-keep 
   -no-cookies-read -no-cookies-set -no-popups -vanilla-wafer -wafer }
 
 </screen>
</para>

<para>
 This is the top section, and only tells us of the compiled in defaults. This 
 is basically what <application>Privoxy</application> would do if there 
 were not any <quote>actions</quote> defined, i.e. it does nothing. Every action 
 is disabled. This is not particularly informative for our purposes here. OK,
 next section:
</para>

<para>
 <screen>

 Matches for http://google.com:

 { -add-header -block +deanimate-gifs -downgrade +fast-redirects 
   +filter{html-annoyances} +filter{js-annoyances} +filter{no-popups} 
   +filter{webbugs} +filter{nimda} +filter{banners-by-size} +filter{hal} 
   +filter{fun} +hide-forwarded +hide-from{block} +hide-referer{forge} 
   -hide-user-agent -image +image-blocker{blank} +no-compression 
   +no-cookies-keep -no-cookies-read -no-cookies-set +no-popups 
   -vanilla-wafer -wafer }
   /

 { -no-cookies-keep -no-cookies-read -no-cookies-set }
  .google.com

 { -fast-redirects }
  .google.com

 </screen>
</para>

<para>
 This is much more informative, and tells us how we have defined our 
 <quote>actions</quote>, and which ones match for our example, 
 <quote>google.com</quote>. The first grouping shows our default 
 settings, which would apply to all URLs. If you look at your <quote>actions</quote>
 file, this would be the section just below the <quote>aliases</quote> section 
 near the top. This applies to all URLs as signified by the single forward
 slash -- <quote>/</quote>.
 
</para>

<para>
 These are the default actions we have enabled. But we can define additional
 actions that would be exceptions to these general rules, and then list 
 specific URLs that these exceptions would apply to. Last match wins.
 Just below this then are two explicit matches for <quote>.google.com</quote>.
 The first is negating our various cookie blocking actions (i.e. we will allow
 cookies here). The second is allowing <quote>fast-redirects</quote>. Note
 that there is a leading dot here -- <quote>.google.com</quote>. This will
 match any hosts and sub-domains, in the google.com domain also, such as
 <quote>www.google.com</quote>. So, apparently, we have these actions defined
 somewhere in the lower part of our actions file, and
 <quote>google.com</quote> is referenced in these sections.

</para>

<para>
 And now we pull it altogether in the bottom section and summarize how
 <application>Privoxy</application> is applying all its <quote>actions</quote> 
 to <quote>google.com</quote>:

</para>

<para>
 <screen>

 Final results:

 -add-header -block -deanimate-gifs -downgrade -fast-redirects 
 +filter{html-annoyances} +filter{js-annoyances} +filter{no-popups} 
 +filter{webbugs} +filter{nimda} +filter{banners-by-size} +filter{hal} 
 +filter{fun} +hide-forwarded +hide-from{block} +hide-referer{forge} 
 -hide-user-agent -image +image-blocker{blank} -limit-connect +no-compression 
 -no-cookies-keep -no-cookies-read -no-cookies-set +no-popups -vanilla-wafer 
 -wafer

 </screen>
</para>

<para>
 Now another example, <quote>ad.doubleclick.net</quote>:
</para>

<para>
 <screen>

 { +block +image }
  .ad.doubleclick.net

 { +block +image }
  ad*.

 { +block +image }
  .doubleclick.net

 </screen>
</para>

<para>
 We'll just show the interesting part here, the explicit matches. It is 
 matched three different times. Each as an <quote>+block +image</quote>,
 which is the expanded form of one of our aliases that had been defined as: 
 <quote>+imageblock</quote>. (<quote>Aliases</quote> are defined in the 
 first section of the actions file and typically used to combine more 
 than one action.)
</para>

<para>
 Any one of these would have done the trick and blocked this as an unwanted 
 image. This is unnecessarily redundant since the last case effectively 
 would also cover the first. No point in taking chances with these guys 
 though ;-) Note that if you want an ad or obnoxious 
 URL to be invisible, it should be defined as <quote>ad.doubleclick.net</quote>
 is done here -- as both a <quote>+block</quote> <emphasis>and</emphasis> an
 <quote>+image</quote>. The custom alias <quote>+imageblock</quote> does this
 for us.
</para>

<para>
 One last example. Let's try <quote>http://www.rhapsodyk.net/adsl/HOWTO/</quote>.
 This one is giving us problems. We are getting a blank page. Hmmm...
</para>

<para>
 <screen>

 Matches for http://www.rhapsodyk.net/adsl/HOWTO/:

 { -add-header -block +deanimate-gifs -downgrade +fast-redirects 
   +filter{html-annoyances} +filter{js-annoyances} +filter{no-popups} 
   +filter{webbugs} +filter{nimda} +filter{banners-by-size} +filter{hal} 
   +filter{fun} +hide-forwarded +hide-from{block} +hide-referer{forge} 
   -hide-user-agent -image +image-blocker{blank} +no-compression 
   +no-cookies-keep -no-cookies-read -no-cookies-set +no-popups 
   -vanilla-wafer -wafer }
   /

 { +block +image }
  /ads

 </screen>
</para>

<para>
 Ooops, the <quote>/adsl/</quote> is matching <quote>/ads</quote>! But 
 we did not want this at all! Now we see why we get the blank page. We could
 now add a new action below this that explicitly does <emphasis>not</emphasis>
 block (-block) pages with <quote>adsl</quote>. There are various ways to
 handle such exceptions. Example:
</para>

<para>
 <screen>

 { -block }
  /adsl
 
 </screen>
</para>

<para>
 Now the page displays ;-) Be sure to flush your browser's caches when 
 making such changes. Or, try using <literal>Shift+Reload</literal>.
</para>

<para>
 But now what about a situation where we get no explicit matches like 
 we did with:
</para>

<para>
 <screen>

 { -block }
  /adsl
 
 </screen>
</para>

<para>
 That actually was very telling and pointed us quickly to where the problem
 was. If you don't get this kind of match, then it means one of the default 
 rules in the first section is causing the problem. This would require some 
 guesswork, and maybe a little trial and error to isolate the offending rule.
 One likely cause would be one of the <quote>{+filter}</quote> actions. Try 
 adding the URL for the site to one of aliases that turn off <quote>+filter</quote>:
</para>

<para>
 <screen>

 {shop}
 .quietpc.com
 .worldpay.com   # for quietpc.com
 .jungle.com
 .scan.co.uk
 .forbes.com
 
 </screen>
</para>

<para>
 <quote>{shop}</quote> is an <quote>alias</quote> that expands to 
 <quote>{ -filter -no-cookies -no-cookies-keep }</quote>. Or you could do 
 your own exception to negate filtering:

</para>

<para>
 <screen>

 {-filter}
 .forbes.com
 
 </screen>
</para>

<para>
 <quote>{fragile}</quote> is an alias that disables most actions. This can be 
 used as a last resort for problem sites. Remember to flush caches! If this 
 still does not work, you will have to go through the remaining actions one by
 one to find which one(s) is causing the problem.
