 into our Developer Manual.

<title>Note to Upgraders</title>
<para>
 There are very significant changes from older versions of 
 <application>Junkbuster</application> to the current
 <application>Privoxy</application>. Configuration is substantially 
 changed. <application>Junkbuster 2.0.x</application> and earlier 
 configuration files will not migrate. The functionality of the old
 <filename>blockfile</filename>, <filename>cookiefile</filename> and
 <filename>imagelist</filename>, are now combined into the
 <ulink url="actions-file.html"><quote>actions files</quote></ulink>.  
 <filename>default.action</filename>, is the main actions file. Local
 exceptions should best be put into <filename>user.action</filename>.
</para>
<para>
 A <ulink url="filter-file.html"><quote>filter file</quote></ulink> (typically
 <filename>default.filter</filename>) is new as of <application>Privoxy
 2.9.x</application>, and provides some of the new sophistication (explained
 below). <filename>config</filename> is much the same as before.
</para>
<para>
 If upgrading from a 2.0.x version, you will have to use the new config 
 files, and possibly adapt any personal rules from your older files.
 When porting personal rules over from the old <filename>blockfile</filename>
 to the new actions files, please note that even the pattern syntax has
 changed. If upgrading from 2.9.x development versions, it is still
 recommended to use the new configuration files.

<para>
 Before launching <application>Privoxy</application> for the first time, you
 will want to configure your browser(s) to use
 <application>Privoxy</application> as a HTTP and HTTPS proxy. The default is
 localhost for the proxy address, and port 8118 (earlier versions used port
 8000). This is the one configuration step that must be done!

must find a better place for this paragraph

<para>
 The included default configuration files should give a reasonable starting
 point. Most of the per site configuration is done in the
 <ulink url="actions-file.html"><quote>actions</quote></ulink> files. These are
 where various cookie actions are defined, ad and banner blocking, and other
 aspects of <application>Privoxy</application> configuration. There are several
 such files included, with varying levels of aggressiveness. 
</para>

<para>
 You will probably want to keep an eye out for sites for which you may prefer
 persistent cookies, and add these to your actions configuration as needed. By
 default, most of these will be accepted only during the current browser
 session (aka <quote>session cookies</quote>), unless you add them to the
 configuration. If you want the browser to handle this instead, you will need
 to edit <filename>user.action</filename> (or through the web based interface)
 and disable this feature. If you use more than one browser, it would make
 more sense to let <application>Privoxy</application> handle this. In which
 case, the browser(s) should be set to accept all cookies.
</para>

<para>
 Another feature where you will probably want to define exceptions for trusted
 sites is the popup-killing (through the <ulink
 url="actions-file.html#KILL-POPUPS"><quote>+kill-popups</quote></ulink>and
 <ulink
 url="actions-file.html#FILTER-POPUPS"><quote>+filter{popups}</quote></ulink>
 actions), because your favorite shopping, banking, or leisure site may need
 popups (explained below). 
</para>

<para>
 <application>Privoxy</application> is HTTP/1.1 compliant,  but not all of
 the optional 1.1 features are as yet supported. In the unlikely event that
 you experience inexplicable problems with browsers that use HTTP/1.1 per default
 (like <application>Mozilla</application> or recent versions of I.E.), you might
 try to force HTTP/1.0 compatibility. For Mozilla, look under <literal>Edit -&gt;
 Preferences -&gt; Debug -&gt; Networking</literal>.
 Alternatively, set the <quote>+downgrade-http-version</quote> config option in
 <filename>default.action</filename> which will downgrade your browser's HTTP
 requests from HTTP/1.1 to HTTP/1.0 before processing them.
</para>

<para>
 After running <application>Privoxy</application> for a while, you can 
 start to fine tune the configuration to suit your personal, or site, 
 preferences and requirements. There are many, many aspects that can 
 be customized. <quote>Actions</quote> 
 can be adjusted by pointing your browser to 
 <ulink url="http://config.privoxy.org/">http://config.privoxy.org/</ulink>
 (shortcut: <ulink url="http://p.p/">http://p.p/</ulink>), 
 and then follow the link to <quote>View &#38; Change the Current Configuration</quote>. 
 (This is an internal page and does not require Internet access.)
</para>

<para>
 In fact, various aspects of <application>Privoxy</application>
 configuration can be viewed from this page, including 
 current configuration parameters, source code version numbers, 
 the browser's request headers, and <quote>actions</quote> that apply 
 to a given URL. In addition to the actions file 
 editor mentioned above, <application>Privoxy</application> can also 
 be turned <quote>on</quote> and <quote>off</quote> (toggled) from this page.
</para>

<para>
 If you encounter problems, try loading the page without
 <application>Privoxy</application>. If that helps, enter the URL where
 you have the problems into <ulink url="http://p.p/show-url-info">the browser
 based rule tracing utility</ulink>. See which rules apply and why, and
 then try turning them off for that site one after the other, until the problem
 is gone. When you have found the culprit, you might want to turn the rest on
 again.
</para>

<para>
 If the above paragraph sounds gibberish to you, you might want to <ulink

<para>
 This should be self-explanatory. Note the first item leads to an editor for the
 <quote>actions list</quote>, which is where the ad, banner, cookie,
 and URL blocking magic is configured as well as other advanced features of
 <application>Privoxy</application>. This is an easy way to adjust various
 aspects of <application>Privoxy</application> configuration. The actions
 file, and other configuration files, are explained in detail below. 
</para>

<para>
 <quote>Toggle Privoxy On or Off</quote> is handy for sites that might 
 have problems with your current actions and filters. You can in fact use
 it as a test to see whether it is <application>Privoxy</application> 
 causing the problem or not. <application>Privoxy</application> continues 
 to run as a proxy in this case, but all filtering is disabled. There
 is even a toggle <link linkend="bookmarklets">Bookmarklet</link> offered, so
 that you can toggle <application>Privoxy</application> with one click from
 your browser.

<title>Configuration Files Overview</title>
<para>
 For Unix, *BSD and Linux, all configuration files are located in
 <filename>/etc/privoxy/</filename> by default. For MS Windows, OS/2, and
 AmigaOS these are all in the same directory as the 
 <application>Privoxy</application> executable. <![%p-not-stable;[ The name
 and number of configuration files has changed from previous versions, and is
 subject to change as development progresses.]]>
</para>

<para>
 The installed defaults provide a reasonable starting point, though 
 some settings may be aggressive by some standards. For the time being, the
 principle configuration files are:
</para>

<para>
 <itemizedlist>

  <listitem>
   <para>
     The main configuration file is named <link linkend="config">config</link>
     on Linux, Unix, BSD, OS/2, and AmigaOS and <filename>config.txt</filename>
     on Windows. This is a required file.
   </para>
  </listitem> 

  <listitem>
   <para>
    <filename>default.action</filename> (the main <link linkend="actions-file">actions file</link>) is used to define
    the default settings for various <quote>actions</quote> relating to images, banners, 
    pop-ups, access restrictions, banners and cookies.
   </para>
   <para>
    Multiple actions files may be defined in <filename>config</filename>. These 
    are processed in the order they are defined. Local customizations and locally 
    preferred exceptions to the default policies as defined in
    <filename>default.action</filename> are probably best applied in
    <filename>user.action</filename>, which should be preserved across
    upgrades. <filename>standard.action</filename> is also included. This is mostly 
    for <application>Privoxy's</application> internal use.
   </para>
   <para>    
    There is also a web based editor that can be accessed from
    <ulink
    url="http://config.privoxy.org/show-status/">http://config.privoxy.org/show-status/</ulink>
    (Shortcut: <ulink
    url="http://p.p/show-status/">http://p.p/show-status/</ulink>) for the
    various actions files. 
   </para>
  </listitem> 

  <listitem>
   <para>
    <filename>default.filter</filename> (the <link linkend="filter-file">filter
    file</link>) can be used to re-write the raw page content, including
    viewable text as well as embedded HTML and JavaScript, and whatever else
    lurks on any given web page. The filtering jobs are only pre-defined here;
    whether to apply them or not is up to the actions files.
   </para>
  </listitem> 

 </itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>
 All files use the <quote><literal>#</literal></quote> character to denote a
 comment (the rest of the line will be ignored) angd understand line continuation
 through placing a backslash ("<literal>\</literal>") as the very last character
 in a line. If the <literal>#</literal> is preceded by a backslash, it looses
 its special function. Placing a <literal>#</literal> in front of an otherwise
 valid configuration line to prevent it from being interpreted is called "commenting
 out" that line.
</para>

<para>
 The actions files and <filename>default.filter</filename> 
 can use Perl style <link linkend="regex">regular expressions</link> for
 maximum flexibility. 
</para>

<para>
 After making any changes, there is no need to restart
 <application>Privoxy</application> in order for the changes to take
 effect. <application>Privoxy</application> detects such changes 
 automatically. Note, however, that it may take one or two additional
 requests for the change to take effect. When changing the listening address
 of <application>Privoxy</application>, these <quote>wake up</quote> requests
 must obviously be sent to the <emphasis>old</emphasis> listening address.
</para>

<![%p-not-stable;[
<para>
 While under development, the configuration content is subject to change. 
 The below documentation may not be accurate by the time you read this. 
 Also, what constitutes a <quote>default</quote> setting, may change, so 
 please check all your configuration files on important issues.

<sect1 id="config">
<title>The Main Configuration File</title>

<para>
 Again, the main configuration file is named <filename>config</filename> on
 Linux/Unix/BSD and OS/2, and <filename>config.txt</filename> on Windows.
 Configuration lines consist of an initial keyword followed by a list of
 values, all separated by whitespace (any number of spaces or tabs). For
 example:
</para>

<para>
 <literal>
  <msgtext> 
   <literallayout>
  <emphasis>confdir /etc/privoxy</emphasis>
   </literallayout>
  </msgtext>
 </literal> 
</para>

<para>
 Assigns the value <literal>/etc/privoxy</literal> to the option
 <literal>confdir</literal> and thus indicates that the configuration
 directory is named <quote>/etc/privoxy/</quote>.
</para>

<para>
 All options in the config file except for <literal>confdir</literal> and
 <literal>logdir</literal> are optional. Watch out in the below description
 for what happens if you leave them unset.
</para>

<para>
 The main config file controls all aspects of <application>Privoxy</application>'s
 operation that are not location dependent (i.e. they apply universally, no matter
 where you may be surfing).
</para>

<title>Configuration and Log File Locations</title>

<para>
 <application>Privoxy</application> can (and normally does) use a number of
 other files for additional configuration, help and logging.

 where to find those other files.

<title>Forwarding</title>

<para>
 This feature allows routing of HTTP requests through a chain of
 multiple proxies.
 It can be used to better protect privacy and confidentiality when
 accessing specific domains by routing requests to those domains
 through an anonymous public proxy (see e.g. <ulink
 url="http://www.multiproxy.org/anon_list.htm">http://www.multiproxy.org/anon_list.htm</ulink>)
 Or to use a caching proxy to speed up browsing. Or chaining to a parent
 proxy may be necessary because the machine that <application>Privoxy</application>
 runs on has no direct Internet access.

<para>
 If you have links to multiple ISPs that provide various special content 
 only to their subscribers, you can configure multiple <application>Privoxies</application>
 which have connections to the respective ISPs to act as forwarders to each other, so that
 <emphasis>your</emphasis> users can see the internal content of all ISPs.
</para>

<para>
 Assume that host-a has a PPP connection to isp-a.net. And host-b has a PPP connection to
 isp-b.net. Both run <application>Privoxy</application>. Their forwarding
 configuration can look like this:
</para>

<para>
 host-a:
</para>

<para>
 <screen>
  forward    .*.         .
  forward    .isp-b.net  host-b:8118
</screen>

</para>

<para>
 <screen>
  forward    .*.         .
  forward    .isp-a.net  host-a:8118
</screen>
</para>

<para>
 Now, your users can set their browser's proxy to use either
 host-a or host-b and be able to browse the internal content
 of both isp-a and isp-b.
</para>

<para>
 If you intend to chain <application>Privoxy</application> and 
 <application>squid</application> locally, then chain as 
 <literal>browser -> squid -> privoxy</literal> is the recommended way. 
</para>

<para>
 Assuming that <application>Privoxy</application> and <application>squid</application>
 run on the same box, your squid configuration could then look like this:
</para>

<para>
 <screen>
  # Define Privoxy as parent proxy (without ICP) 
  cache_peer 127.0.0.1 parent 8118 7 no-query 

  # Define ACL for protocol FTP 
  acl ftp proto FTP 

  # Do not forward FTP requests to Privoxy
  always_direct allow ftp 

  # Forward all the rest to Privoxy
  never_direct allow all</screen>
</para>

<para>
 You would then need to change your browser's proxy settings to <application>squid</application>'s address and port.
 Squid normally uses port 3128. If unsure consult <literal>http_port</literal> in <filename>squid.conf</filename>.

<sect1 id="actions-file"><title>Actions Files</title>

<para>
 The actions files are used to define what actions
 <application>Privoxy</application> takes for which URLs, and thus determines
 how ad images, cookies and various other aspects of HTTP content and
 transactions are handled, and on which sites (or even parts thereof). There 
 are three such files included with <application>Privoxy</application>, 
 with slightly different purposes. <filename>default.action</filename> sets
 the default policies. <filename>standard.action</filename> is used by 
 <application>Privoxy</application> and the web based editor to set 
 pre-defined values (and normally should not be edited). Local exceptions 
 are best done in <filename>user.action</filename>. The content of these 
 can all be viewed and edited from <ulink
 url="http://config.privoxy.org/show-status">http://config.privoxy.org/show-status</ulink>.
 </para>

<para> 
 Anything you want can be blocked, including ads, banners, or just some obnoxious
 URL that you would rather not see is done here. Cookies can be accepted or rejected, or
 accepted only during the current browser session (i.e. not written to disk),
 content can be modified, JavaScripts tamed, user-tracking fooled, and much more.
 See below for a complete list of available actions.
</para>

<para>
 An actions file typically has sections. Near the top, <quote>aliases</quote> are 
 optionally defined (discussed <ulink
 url="actions-file.html#ALIASES">below</ulink>), then the default set of rules
 which will apply universally to all sites and pages. And then below that,
 exceptions to the defined universal policies. 
</para>

<!--   ~~~~~       New section      ~~~~~     -->
<sect2>
<title>Finding the Right Mix</title>
<para>
 Note that some <link linkend="actions">actions</link>, like cookie suppression
 or script disabling, may render some sites unusable that rely on these
 techniques to work properly. Finding the right mix of actions is not always easy and
 certainly a matter of personal taste. In general, it can be said that the more
 <quote>aggressive</quote> your default settings (in the top section of the
 actions file) are, the more exceptions for <quote>trusted</quote> sites you
 will have to make later. If, for example, you want to kill popup windows per
 default, you'll have to make exceptions from that rule for sites that you
 regularly use and that require popups for actually useful content, like maybe
 your bank, favorite shop, or newspaper.
</para>

<para>
 We have tried to provide you with reasonable rules to start from in the
 distribution actions files. But there is no general rule of thumb on these
 things. There just are too many variables, and sites are constantly changing.
 Sooner or later you will want to change the rules (and read this chapter again :).
</para>
</sect2>

<!--   ~~~~~       New section      ~~~~~     -->
<sect2>
<title>How to Edit</title>
<para>
 The easiest way to edit the <quote>actions</quote> files is with a browser by
 using our browser-based editor, which can be reached from <ulink
 url="http://config.privoxy.org/show-status">http://config.privoxy.org/show-status</ulink>.
</para>

<para>
 If you prefer plain text editing to GUIs, you can of course also directly edit the
 the actions files.
</para>
</sect2>


<sect2>
<title>How Actions are Applied to URLs</title>
<para>
 Actions files are divided into sections. There are special sections,
 like the <quote><link linkend="aliases">alias</link></quote> sections which will be discussed later. For now
 let's concentrate on regular sections: They have a heading line (often split
 up to multiple lines for readability) which consist of a list of actions,
 separated by whitespace and enclosed in curly braces. Below that, there
 is a list of URL patterns, each on a separate line.
</para>

<para>
 To determine which actions apply to a request, the URL of the request is
 compared to all patterns in this file. Every time it matches, the list of
 applicable actions for the URL is incrementally updated, using the heading
 of the section in which the pattern is located. If multiple matches for
 the same URL set the same action differently, the last match wins. If not, 
 the effects are aggregated (e.g. a URL might match both the 
 <ulink url="actions-file.html#HANDLE-AS-IMAGE"><quote>+handle-as-image</quote></ulink>
 and <ulink url="actions-file.html#BLOCK"><quote>+block</quote></ulink> actions).
 
</para>

<para>
 You can trace this process by visiting <ulink
 url="http://config.privoxy.org/show-url-info">http://config.privoxy.org/show-url-info</ulink>.
</para>

<para>
 More detail on this is provided in the Appendix, <link linkend="ACTIONSANAT">
 Anatomy of an Action</link>.
</para>
</sect2>

<!--   ~~~~~       New section      ~~~~~     -->
<sect2>
<title>Patterns</title>
<para>
 Generally, a pattern has the form <literal>&lt;domain&gt;/&lt;path&gt;</literal>,
 where both the <literal>&lt;domain&gt;</literal> and <literal>&lt;path&gt;</literal>
 are optional. (This is why the pattern <literal>/</literal> matches all URLs).
</para>

<variablelist>
 <varlistentry>
  <term><literal>www.example.com/</literal></term>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    is a domain-only pattern and will match any request to <literal>www.example.com</literal>,
    regardless of which document on that server is requested.
   </para>
  </listitem>
 </varlistentry>
 <varlistentry>
  <term><literal>www.example.com</literal></term>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    means exactly the same. For domain-only patterns, the trailing <literal>/</literal> may
    be omitted.

  </listitem>
 </varlistentry>
 <varlistentry>
  <term><literal>www.example.com/index.html</literal></term>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    matches only the single document <literal>/index.html</literal>
    on <literal>www.example.com</literal>.
   </para>
  </listitem>
 </varlistentry>
 <varlistentry>
  <term><literal>/index.html</literal></term>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    matches the document <literal>/index.html</literal>, regardless of the domain,
    i.e. on <emphasis>any</emphasis> web server.
   </para>
  </listitem>
 </varlistentry>
 <varlistentry>
  <term><literal>index.html</literal></term>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    matches nothing, since it would be  interpreted as a domain name and
    there is no top-level domain called <literal>.html</literal>.
   </para>
  </listitem>
 </varlistentry>
</variablelist>


<!--   ~~~~~       New section      ~~~~~     -->
<sect3><title>The Domain Pattern</title>

<para>
 The matching of the domain part offers some flexible options: if the
 domain starts or ends with a dot, it becomes unanchored at that end. 
 For example:
</para>

<variablelist>
 <varlistentry>
  <term><literal>.example.com</literal></term>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    matches any domain that <emphasis>ENDS</emphasis> in
    <literal>.example.com</literal>
   </para>
  </listitem>
 </varlistentry>
 <varlistentry>
  <term><literal>www.</literal></term>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    matches any domain that <emphasis>STARTS</emphasis> with
    <literal>www.</literal>
   </para>
  </listitem>
 </varlistentry>
 <varlistentry>
  <term><literal>.example.</literal></term>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    matches any domain that <emphasis>CONTAINS</emphasis> <literal>.example.</literal>
    (Correctly speaking: It matches any FQDN that contains <literal>example</literal> as a domain.)
   </para>
  </listitem>
 </varlistentry>
</variablelist>

<para>
 Additionally, there are wild-cards that you can use in the domain names
 themselves. They work pretty similar to shell wild-cards: <quote>*</quote>
 stands for zero or more arbitrary characters, <quote>?</quote> stands for
 any single character, you can define character classes in square
 brackets and all of that can be freely mixed:
</para>

<variablelist>
 <varlistentry>
  <term><literal>ad*.example.com</literal></term>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    matches <quote>adserver.example.com</quote>, 
    <quote>ads.example.com</quote>, etc but not <quote>sfads.example.com</quote>
   </para>
  </listitem>
 </varlistentry>
 <varlistentry>
  <term><literal>*ad*.example.com</literal></term>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    matches all of the above, and then some.
   </para>
  </listitem>
 </varlistentry>
 <varlistentry>
  <term><literal>.?pix.com</literal></term>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    matches <literal>www.ipix.com</literal>,

<sect3><title>The Path Pattern</title>

<para>
 <application>Privoxy</application> uses Perl compatible regular expressions
 (through the <ulink url="http://www.pcre.org/">PCRE</ulink> library) for
 matching the path.
</para>

<para>
 There is an <link linkend="regex">Appendix</link> with a brief quick-start into regular
 expressions, and full (very technical) documentation on PCRE regex syntax is available on-line
 at <ulink url="http://www.pcre.org/man.txt">http://www.pcre.org/man.txt</ulink>.
 You might also find the Perl man page on regular expressions (<literal>man perlre</literal>)
 useful, which is available on-line at <ulink
 url="http://www.perldoc.com/perl5.6/pod/perlre.html">http://www.perldoc.com/perl5.6/pod/perlre.html</ulink>.
</para>

<para>
 Note that the path pattern is automatically left-anchored at the <quote>/</quote>,
 i.e. it matches as if it would start with a <quote>^</quote> (regular expression speak 
 for the beginning of a line).
</para>

<para>
 Please also note that matching in the path is case
 <emphasis>INSENSITIVE</emphasis> by default, but you can switch to case
 sensitive at any point in the pattern by using the 
 <quote>(?-i)</quote> switch:
 <literal>www.example.com/(?-i)PaTtErN.*</literal> will match only
 documents whose path starts with <literal>PaTtErN</literal> in
 <emphasis>exactly</emphasis> this capitalization.

<sect2 id="actions">
<title>Actions</title>
<para>
 All actions are disabled by default, until they are explicitly enabled
 somewhere in an actions file. Actions are turned on if preceded with a
 <quote>+</quote>, and turned off if preceded with a <quote>-</quote>. So a
 <quote>+action</quote> means <quote>do that action</quote>, e.g.
 <quote>+block</quote> means please <quote>block the following URL
 patterns</quote>. 
</para>

<para> 
 Actions are invoked by enclosing the action name in curly braces (e.g.
 {+some_action}), followed by a list of URLs (or patterns that match URLs) to
 which the action applies. There are three classes of actions: 
</para>

<para>

<para>
 If nothing is specified in any actions file, no <quote>actions</quote> are
 taken. So in this case <application>Privoxy</application> would just be a
 normal, non-blocking, non-anonymizing proxy. You must specifically enable the
 privacy and blocking features you need (although the provided default actions
 files will give a good starting point).
</para>

<para>
 Later defined actions always over-ride earlier ones.  So exceptions 
 to any rules you make, should come in the latter part of the file (or 
 in a file that is processed later when using multiple actions files). For
 multi-valued actions, the actions are applied in the order they are specified.
 Actions files are processed in the order they are defined in
 <filename>config</filename> (the default installation has three actions
 files). It also quite possible for any given URL pattern to match more than
 one action!

    If a URL matches one of the blocked patterns, <application>Privoxy</application>
    will intercept the URL and display its special <quote>BLOCKED</quote> page
    instead. If there is sufficient space, a large red banner will appear with
    a friendly message about why the page was blocked, and a way to go there
    anyway. If there is insufficient space a smaller <quote>BLOCKED</quote>
    page will appear without the red banner. 
    <ulink url="http://ads.bannerserver.example.com/nasty-ads/sponsor.html">Click here</ulink>
    to view the default blocked HTML page (<application>Privoxy</application> must be running 
    for this to work as intended!).

    then it will be handled by

    De-animate all animated GIF images, i.e. reduce them to their last frame.
    This will also shrink the images considerably (in bytes, not pixels!). If
    the option <quote>first</quote> is given, the first frame of the animation
    is used as the replacement. If <quote>last</quote> is given, the last
    frame of the animation is used instead, which probably makes more sense for
    most banner animations, but also has the risk of not showing the entire
    last frame (if it is only a delta to an earlier frame).

    Many sites, like yahoo.com, don't just link to other sites. Instead, they
    will link to some script on their own server, giving the destination as a
    parameter, which will then redirect you to the final target. URLs
    resulting from this scheme typically look like:
    <emphasis>http://some.place/some_script?http://some.where-else</emphasis>.
  </para>
   <para>
    Sometimes, there are even multiple consecutive redirects encoded in the
    URL. These redirections via scripts make your web browsing more traceable,
    since the server from which you follow such a link can see where you go
    to. Apart from that, valuable bandwidth and time is wasted, while your
    browser ask the server for one redirect after the other. Plus, it feeds
    the advertisers.
   </para>

    This is a normally <quote>on</quote> feature, and often requires exceptions

    This is potentially a very powerful feature! And requires a knowledge 
    of regular expressions if you want to <quote>roll your own</quote>.
    Filtering operates on a line by line basis throughout the entire page.
   </para>
   <para>
    Filtering requires buffering the page content, which may appear to
    slow down page rendering since nothing is displayed until all content has
    passed the filters. (It does not really take longer, but seems that way
    since the page is not incrementally displayed.) This effect will be more
    noticeable on slower connections.
   </para>
   <para>
    Filtering can achieve some of the effects as the 
    <ulink url="actions-file#BLOCK"><quote>+block</quote></ulink>
    action, i.e. it can be used to block ads and banners. In the overall 
    scheme of things, filtering is one of the first things <quote>Privoxy</quote> 
    does with a web page. So other most other actions are applied to the 
    already <quote>filtered</quote> page.

    The CONNECT methods exists in HTTP to allow access to secure websites
    (https:// URLs) through proxies. It works very simply: the proxy connects
    to the server on the specified port, and then short-circuits its
    connections to the client <emphasis>and</emphasis> to the remote proxy.
    This can be a big security hole, since CONNECT-enabled proxies can be
    abused as TCP relays very easily.
  </para>
  <para> 
   If you want to allow CONNECT for more ports than this, or want to forbid
   CONNECT altogether, you can specify a comma separated list of ports and
   port ranges (the latter using dashes, with the minimum defaulting to 0 and
   max to 65K).

 Note that many of these actions have the potential to cause a page to
 misbehave, possibly even not to display at all. There are many ways 
 a site designer may choose to design his site, and what HTTP header

 and fast rules for all sites. See the <link

 actions.

 Remember that the meaning of any of the above references is reversed by preceding
 the action with a <quote>-</quote>, in place of the <quote>+</quote>. Also, 
 that some actions are turned on in the default section of the actions file, 
 and require little to no additional configuration. These are just <quote>on</quote>.
</para>

<para>
 But, other actions that are turned on in the default section <emphasis>do
 typically require</emphasis> exceptions to be listed in the latter sections of 
 one of our actions file. For instance, by default no URLs are
 <quote>blocked</quote> (i.e. in the default definitions of
 <filename>default.action</filename>). We need exceptions to this in order to
 <emphasis>enable</emphasis> ad blocking in the lower sections. But we need to
 be very selective about what we do block. Thus, the default is <quote>off</quote>
 for blocking.

 So far we are painting with a broad brush by setting general policies. 
 The above would be a reasonable starting point for many situations. Now, 
 we want to be more specific and have customized rules that are more suitable
 to our personal habits and preferences. These would be for narrowly defined 
 situations like your ISP or your bank, and should be placed in

<para>
 Custom <quote>actions</quote>, known to <application>Privoxy</application>
 as <quote>aliases</quote>, can be defined by combining other <quote>actions</quote>.
 These can in turn be invoked just like the built-in <quote>actions</quote>.
 Currently, an alias can contain any character except space, tab, <quote>=</quote>,
 <quote>{</quote> or <quote>}</quote>. But please use only <quote>a</quote>-
 <quote>z</quote>, <quote>0</quote>-<quote>9</quote>, <quote>+</quote>, and
 <quote>-</quote>. Alias names are not case sensitive, and 
 <emphasis>must be defined before other actions</emphasis> in the
 actions file! And there can only be one set of <quote>aliases</quote>
 defined per file. Each actions file may have its own aliases, but they are 
 only visible within that file. Aliases do not requir a <quote>+</quote> or 
 <quote>-</quote> sign in front, since they are merely expanded.
</para>

<para>
 Now let's define a few aliases:
</para>

 # Useful custom aliases we can use later. These must come first!

 fragile     = -block -prevent-cookies -filter -fast-redirects -hide-referer -kill-popups
 shop        = -prevent-cookies -filter -fast-redirects
 +imageblock = +block +handle-as-image

 # Aliases defined from other aliases, for people who don't like to type 
 # too much:  ;-)
 c0 = +prevent-cookies
 c1 = -prevent-cookies
 #... etc.  Customize to your heart's content.

<title>Regular Expressions</title>
<para>
 <application>Privoxy</application> can use <quote>regular expressions</quote> 
 in various config files. Assuming support for <quote>pcre</quote> (Perl
 Compatible Regular Expressions) is compiled in, which is the default. Such
 configuration directives do not require regular expressions, but they can be
 used to increase flexibility by matching a pattern with wild-cards against
 URLs.
</para>

<para>
 If you are reading this, you probably don't understand what <quote>regular
 expressions</quote> are, or what they can do. So this will be a very brief
 introduction only. A full explanation would require a book ;-)
</para>

<para>
 <quote>Regular expressions</quote> is a way of matching one character
 expression against another to see if it matches or not. One of the
 <quote>expressions</quote> is a literal string of readable characters
 (letter, numbers, etc), and the other is a complex string of literal
 characters combined with wild-cards, and other special characters, called
 meta-characters. The <quote>meta-characters</quote> have special meanings and
 are used to build the complex pattern to be matched against. Perl Compatible
 Regular Expressions is an enhanced form of the regular expression language
 with backward compatibility.
</para>

<para>
 To make a simple analogy, we do something similar when we use wild-card
 characters when listing files with the <command>dir</command> command in DOS. 
 <literal>*.*</literal> matches all filenames. The <quote>special</quote>
 character here is the asterisk which matches any and all characters. We can be
 more specific and use <literal>?</literal> to match just individual
 characters. So <quote>dir file?.text</quote> would match
 <quote>file1.txt</quote>, <quote>file2.txt</quote>, etc. We are pattern
 matching, using a similar technique to <quote>regular expressions</quote>!
</para>

<para>
 Regular expressions do essentially the same thing, but are much, much more
 powerful. There are many more <quote>special characters</quote> and ways of 
 building complex patterns however. Let's look at a few of the common ones,
 and then some examples:
</para>

<para><simplelist>
 <member>
  <emphasis>.</emphasis> - Matches any single character, e.g. <quote>a</quote>,
  <quote>A</quote>, <quote>4</quote>, <quote>:</quote>, or <quote>@</quote>.
 </member>
</simplelist></para>

<para><simplelist>
 <member>
  <emphasis>?</emphasis> - The preceding character or expression is matched ZERO or ONE
  times. Either/or.
 </member>
</simplelist></para>

<para><simplelist>
 <member>
  <emphasis>+</emphasis> - The preceding character or expression is matched ONE or MORE
  times.
 </member>
</simplelist></para>

<para><simplelist>
 <member>
  <emphasis>*</emphasis> - The preceding character or expression is matched ZERO or MORE
  times.
 </member>
</simplelist></para>

<para><simplelist>
 <member>
  <emphasis>\</emphasis> - The <quote>escape</quote> character denotes that
  the following character should be taken literally. This is used where one of the 
  special characters (e.g. <quote>.</quote>) needs to be taken literally and
  not as a special meta-character. Example: <quote>example\.com</quote>, makes 
  sure the period is recognized only as a period (and not expanded to its 
  meta-character meaning of any single character).
 </member>
</simplelist></para>

<para><simplelist>
 <member>
  <emphasis>[]</emphasis> - Characters enclosed in brackets will be matched if
  any of the enclosed characters are encountered. For instance, <quote>[0-9]</quote>
  matches any numeric digit (zero through nine). As an example, we can combine 
  this with <quote>+</quote> to match any digit one of more times: <quote>[0-9]+</quote>.
 </member>
</simplelist></para>

<para><simplelist>
 <member>
  <emphasis>()</emphasis> - parentheses are used to group a sub-expression,
  or multiple sub-expressions.
 </member>
</simplelist></para>

<para><simplelist>
 <member>
  <emphasis>|</emphasis> - The <quote>bar</quote> character works like an
  <quote>or</quote> conditional statement. A match is successful if the
  sub-expression on either side of <quote>|</quote> matches. As an example:
  <quote>/(this|that) example/</quote> uses grouping and the bar character 
  and would match either <quote>this example</quote> or <quote>that
  example</quote>, and nothing else.
 </member>
</simplelist></para>

<para><simplelist>
 <member>
  <emphasis>s/string1/string2/g</emphasis> - This is used to rewrite strings of text. 
  <quote>string1</quote> is replaced by <quote>string2</quote> in this
  example. There must of course be a match on <quote>string1</quote> first.
 </member>
</simplelist></para>

<para>
 These are just some of the ones you are likely to use when matching URLs with 
 <application>Privoxy</application>, and is a long way from a definitive
 list. This is enough to get us started with a few simple examples which may
 be more illuminating:
</para>

<para>
 <emphasis><literal>/.*/banners/.*</literal></emphasis> - A  simple example
 that uses the common combination of <quote>.</quote> and <quote>*</quote> to 
 denote any character, zero or more times. In other words, any string at all.
 So we start with a literal forward slash, then our regular expression pattern 
 (<quote>.*</quote>) another literal forward slash, the string
 <quote>banners</quote>, another forward slash, and lastly another
 <quote>.*</quote>. We are building 
 a directory path here. This will match any file with the path that has a
 directory named <quote>banners</quote> in it. The <quote>.*</quote> matches
 any characters, and this could conceivably be more forward slashes, so it
 might expand into a much longer looking path. For example, this could match:
 <quote>/eye/hate/spammers/banners/annoy_me_please.gif</quote>, or just
 <quote>/banners/annoying.html</quote>, or almost an infinite number of other
 possible combinations, just so it has <quote>banners</quote> in the path
 somewhere.
</para>

<para>
 A now something a little more complex:
</para>

<para>
 <emphasis><literal>/.*/adv((er)?ts?|ertis(ing|ements?))?/</literal></emphasis> - 
 We have several literal forward slashes again (<quote>/</quote>), so we are
 building another expression that is a file path statement. We have another 
 <quote>.*</quote>, so we are matching against any conceivable sub-path, just so
 it matches our expression. The only true literal that <emphasis>must
 match</emphasis> our pattern is <application>adv</application>, together with
 the forward slashes. What comes after the <quote>adv</quote> string is the
 interesting part. 
</para>

<para>
 Remember the <quote>?</quote> means the preceding expression (either a
 literal character or anything grouped with <quote>(...)</quote> in this case)
 can exist or not, since this means either zero or one match. So
 <quote>((er)?ts?|ertis(ing|ements?))</quote> is optional, as are the
 individual sub-expressions: <quote>(er)</quote>,
 <quote>(ing|ements?)</quote>, and the <quote>s</quote>. The <quote>|</quote>
 means <quote>or</quote>. We have two of those. For instance, 
 <quote>(ing|ements?)</quote>, can expand to match either <quote>ing</quote> 
 <emphasis>OR</emphasis> <quote>ements?</quote>. What is being done here, is an
 attempt at matching as many variations of <quote>advertisement</quote>, and 
 similar, as possible. So this would expand to match just <quote>adv</quote>,
 or <quote>advert</quote>, or <quote>adverts</quote>, or
 <quote>advertising</quote>, or <quote>advertisement</quote>, or
 <quote>advertisements</quote>. You get the idea. But it would not match 
 <quote>advertizements</quote> (with a <quote>z</quote>). We could fix that by
 changing our regular expression to: 
 <quote>/.*/adv((er)?ts?|erti(s|z)(ing|ements?))?/</quote>, which would then match
 either spelling.
</para>

<para>
 <emphasis><literal>/.*/advert[0-9]+\.(gif|jpe?g)</literal></emphasis> - Again 
 another path statement with forward slashes. Anything in the square brackets 
 <quote>[]</quote> can be matched. This is using <quote>0-9</quote> as a
 shorthand expression to mean any digit one through nine. It is the same as
 saying <quote>0123456789</quote>. So any digit matches. The <quote>+</quote>
 means one or more of the preceding expression must be included. The preceding 
 expression here is what is in the square brackets -- in this case, any digit 
 one through nine. Then, at the end, we have a grouping: <quote>(gif|jpe?g)</quote>. 
 This includes a <quote>|</quote>, so this needs to match the expression on
 either side of that bar character also. A simple <quote>gif</quote> on one side, and the other
 side will in turn match either <quote>jpeg</quote> or <quote>jpg</quote>,
 since the <quote>?</quote> means the letter <quote>e</quote> is optional and
 can be matched once or not at all. So we are building an expression here to
 match image GIF or JPEG type image file. It must include the literal
 string <quote>advert</quote>, then one or more digits, and a <quote>.</quote>
 (which is now a literal, and not a special character, since it is escaped
 with <quote>\</quote>), and lastly either <quote>gif</quote>, or
 <quote>jpeg</quote>, or <quote>jpg</quote>. Some possible matches would
 include: <quote>//advert1.jpg</quote>,
 <quote>/nasty/ads/advert1234.gif</quote>,
 <quote>/banners/from/hell/advert99.jpg</quote>. It would not match
 <quote>advert1.gif</quote> (no leading slash), or
 <quote>/adverts232.jpg</quote> (the expression does not include an
 <quote>s</quote>), or <quote>/advert1.jsp</quote> (<quote>jsp</quote> is not
 in the expression anywhere).
</para>

<para>
 <emphasis><literal>s/microsoft(?!.com)/MicroSuck/i</literal></emphasis> - This is 
 a substitution. <quote>MicroSuck</quote> will replace any occurrence of 
 <quote>microsoft</quote>.  The <quote>i</quote> at the end of the expression
 means ignore case. The <quote>(?!.com)</quote> means 
 the match should fail if <quote>microsoft</quote> is followed by
 <quote>.com</quote>. In other words, this acts like a <quote>NOT</quote>
 modifier. In case this is a hyperlink, we don't want to break it ;-).
</para>

<para>
 We are barely scratching the surface of regular expressions here so that you
 can understand the default <application>Privoxy</application>
 configuration files, and maybe use this knowledge to customize your own
 installation. There is much, much more that can be done with regular
 expressions. Now that you know enough to get started, you can learn more on
 your own :/

<sect2 id="chain">
<title>Chain of Events</title>
<para>
 Let's take a quick look at the basic sequence of events when a web page is 
 requested by your browser and <application>Privoxy</application> is on duty:
</para>

<para>
 <itemizedlist>
 <listitem>
  <para>
   First, your web browser requests a web page. The browser knows to send 
   the request to <application>Privoxy</application>, which will in turn, 
   relay the request to the remote web server after passing the following 
   tests: 
  </para>
 </listitem> 
 <listitem>
  <para>
   <application>Privoxy</application> traps any request for its own internal CGI 
   pages (e.g http://p.p/) and sends the CGI page back to the browser.
  </para>
 </listitem> 
 <listitem>
  <para>
   Next, <application>Privoxy</application> checks to see if the URL 
   matches any <ulink
   url="actions-file.html#BLOCK"><quote>+block</quote></ulink> patterns. If
   so, the URL is then blocked, and the remote web server will not be contacted.
   <ulink url="actions-file.html#HANDLE-AS-IMAGE"><quote>+handle-as-image</quote></ulink> 
   is then checked and if it does not match, an 
   HTML <quote>BLOCKED</quote> page is sent back. Otherwise, if it does match,
   an image is returned. The type of image depends on the setting of <ulink
   url="actions-file.html#SET-IMAGE-BLOCKER"><quote>+set-image-blocker</quote></ulink>
   (blank, checkerboard pattern, or an HTTP redirect to an image elsewhere).
  </para>
 </listitem> 
 <listitem>
  <para>
   Untrusted URLs are blocked. If URLs are being added to the
   <filename>trust</filename> file, then that is done.
  </para>
 </listitem> 
 <listitem>
  <para>
   If the URL pattern matches the <ulink
   url="actions-file.html#FAST-REDIRECTS"><quote>+fast-redirects</quote></ulink> action,
   it is then processed. Unwanted parts of the requested URL are stripped.
  </para>
 </listitem> 
 <listitem>
  <para>
   Now the rest of the client browser's request headers are processed. If any
   of these match any of the relevant actions (e.g. <ulink
   url="actions-file.html#HIDE-USER-AGENT"><quote>+hide-user-agent</quote></ulink>,
   etc.), headers are suppressed or forged as determined by these actions and
   their parameters.
  </para>
 </listitem> 
 <listitem>
  <para>
   Now the web server starts sending its response back (i.e. typically a web page and related 
   data).
  </para>
 </listitem> 
 <listitem>
  <para>
   First, the server headers are read and processed to determine, among other
   things, the MIME type (document type) and encoding. The headers are then
   filtered as deterimed by the 
   <ulink url="actions-file.html#PREVENT-SETTING-COOKIES"><quote>+prevent-setting-cookies</quote></ulink>,
   <ulink url="actions-file.html#SESSION-COOKIES-ONLY"><quote>+session-cookies-only</quote></ulink>,
   and <ulink url="actions-file.html#DOWNGRADE-HTTP-VERSION"><quote>+downgrade-http-version</quote></ulink>
   actions.
  </para>
 </listitem> 
 <listitem>
  <para>
   If the <ulink url="actions-file.html#KILL-POPUPS"><quote>+kill-popups</quote></ulink>
   action applies, and it is an HTML or JavaScript document, the popup-code in the
   response is filtered on-the-fly as it is received.
  </para>
 </listitem> 
 <listitem>
  <para>
   If a <ulink url="actions-file.html#FILTER"><quote>+filter</quote></ulink>
   or <ulink
   url="actions-file.html#DEANIMATE-GIFS"><quote>+deanimate-gifs</quote></ulink>
   action applies (and the document type fits the action), the rest of the page is
   read into memory (up to a configurable limit). Then the filter rules (from
   <filename>default.filter</filename>) are processed against the buffered
   content. Filters are applied in the order they are specified in the
   <filename>default.filter</filename> file. Animated GIFs, if present, are
   reduced to either the first or last frame, depending on the action
   setting.The entire page, which is now filtered, is then sent by
   <application>Privoxy</application> back to your browser. 
  </para>
  <para>
   If neither <ulink url="actions-file.html#FILTER"><quote>+filter</quote></ulink>
   or <ulink
   url="actions-file.html#DEANIMATE-GIFS"><quote>+deanimate-gifs</quote></ulink>
   matches, then <application>Privoxy</application> passes the raw data through 
   to the client browser as it becomes available.
  </para>
 </listitem> 
 <listitem>
  <para>
   As the browser receives the now (probably filtered) page content, it 
   reads and then requests any URLs that may be embedded within the page
   source, e.g. ad images, stylesheets, JavaScript, other HTML documents (e.g.
   frames), sounds, etc. For each of these objects, the browser issues a new
   request. And each such request is in turn processed as above. Note that a
   complex web page may have many such embedded URLs.
  </para>
 </listitem> 
 
 </itemizedlist>
</para>

<!--   ~~~~~       New section      ~~~~~     -->
<sect2 id="actionsanat">
<title>Anatomy of an Action</title>

<para>
 The way <application>Privoxy</application> applies 
 <ulink url="actions-file.html#ACTIONS"><quote>actions</quote></ulink>
 and <ulink url="actions-file.html#FILTER"><quote>filters</quote></ulink>
 to any given URL can be complex, and not always so
 easy to understand what is happening. And sometimes we need to be able to
 <emphasis>see</emphasis> just what <application>Privoxy</application> is
 doing. Especially, if something <application>Privoxy</application> is doing
 is causing us a problem inadvertently. It can be a little daunting to look at
 the actions and filters files themselves, since they tend to be filled with
 <quote>regular expressions</quote> whose consequences are not always 
 so obvious. 
</para>

<para>
 One quick test to see if <application>Privoxy</application> is causing a problem 
 or not, is to disable it temporarily. This should be the first troubleshooting 
 step. See <link linkend="bookmarklets">the Bookmarklets</link> section on a quick 
 and easy way to do this (be sure to flush caches afterward!).
</para>

<para>
 <application>Privoxy</application> also provides the 
 <ulink url="http://config.privoxy.org/show-url-info">http://config.privoxy.org/show-url-info</ulink>
 page that can show us very specifically how <application>actions</application>
 are being applied to any given URL. This is a big help for troubleshooting.
</para>

<para>
 First, enter one URL (or partial URL) at the prompt, and then
 <application>Privoxy</application> will tell us 
 how the current configuration will handle it. This will not
 help with filtering effects (i.e. the <ulink
 url="actions-file.html#FILTER"><quote>+filter</quote></ulink> action) from
 the <filename>default.filter</filename> file since this is handled very
 differently and not so easy to trap! It also will not tell you about any other
 URLs that may be embedded within the URL you are testing. For instance, images
 such as ads are expressed as URLs within the raw page source of HTML pages. So
 you will only get info for the actual URL that is pasted into the prompt area
 -- not any sub-URLs. If you want to know about embedded URLs like ads, you
 will have to dig those out of the HTML source. Use your browser's <quote>View
 Page Source</quote> option for this. Or right click on the ad, and grab the
 URL.
</para>

<para>
 Let's try an example, <ulink url="http://google.com">google.com</ulink>, 
 and look at it one section at a time:
</para>

<para>
 <screen>
 Matches for http://google.com:

--- File standard ---
(no matches in this file)

--- File default ---

{ -add-header -block +deanimate-gifs{last} -downgrade-http-version +fast-redirects 
 -filter{popups} -filter{fun} -filter{shockwave-flash} -filter{crude-parental} 
 +filter{html-annoyances} +filter{js-annoyances} +filter{content-cookies} 
 +filter{webbugs} +filter{refresh-tags} +filter{nimda} +filter{banners-by-size} 
 +hide-forwarded-for-headers +hide-from-header{block} +hide-referer{forge} 
 -hide-user-agent -handle-as-image +set-image-blocker{pattern} -limit-connect 
 +prevent-compression +session-cookies-only -prevent-reading-cookies 
 -prevent-setting-cookies -kill-popups -send-vanilla-wafer -send-wafer }
/

 { -session-cookies-only }
 .google.com

 { -fast-redirects }
 .google.com

--- File user ---
(no matches in this file)  
</screen>
</para>

<para>
 This tells us how we have defined our 
 <ulink url="actions-file.html#ACTIONS"><quote>actions</quote></ulink>, and
 which ones match for our example, <quote>google.com</quote>. The first listing
 is any matches for the <filename>standard.action</filename> file. No hits at
 all here on <quote>standard</quote>. Then next is <quote>default</quote>, or
 our <filename>default.action</filename> file. The large, multi-line listing,
 is how the actions are set to match for all URLs, i.e. our default settings.
 If you look at your <quote>actions</quote> file, this would be the section
 just below the <quote>aliases</quote> section near the top. This will apply to
 all URLs as signified by the single forward slash at the end of the listing
 -- <quote>/</quote>.
</para>

<para>
 But we can define additional actions that would be exceptions to these general
 rules, and then list specific URLs (or patterns) that these exceptions would
 apply to. Last match wins. Just below this then are two explicit matches for
 <quote>.google.com</quote>. The first is negating our previous cookie setting, 
 which was for <ulink
 url="actions-file.html#SESSION-COOKIES-ONLY"><quote>+session-cookies-only</quote></ulink>
 (i.e. not persistent). So we will allow persistent cookies for google. The
 second turns <emphasis>off</emphasis> any 
 <ulink
 url="actions-file.html#FAST-REDIRECTS"><quote>+fast-redirects</quote></ulink>
 action, allowing this to take place unmolested. Note that there is a leading
 dot here -- <quote>.google.com</quote>. This will match any hosts and
 sub-domains, in the google.com domain also, such as
 <quote>www.google.com</quote>. So, apparently, we have these two actions
 defined somewhere in the lower part of our <filename>default.action</filename>
 file, and <quote>google.com</quote> is referenced somewhere in these latter
 sections.
</para>

<para>
 Then, for our <filename>user.action</filename> file, we again have no hits.
</para>

<para>
 And finally we pull it all together in the bottom section and summarize how
 <application>Privoxy</application> is applying all its <quote>actions</quote> 
 to <quote>google.com</quote>:

</para>

<para>
 <screen>

 Final results:
 -add-header -block +deanimate-gifs{last} -downgrade-http-version -fast-redirects 
 -filter{popups} -filter{fun} -filter{shockwave-flash} -filter{crude-parental} 
 +filter{html-annoyances} +filter{js-annoyances} +filter{content-cookies} 
 +filter{webbugs} +filter{refresh-tags} +filter{nimda} +filter{banners-by-size} 
 +hide-forwarded-for-headers +hide-from-header{block} +hide-referer{forge} 
 -hide-user-agent -handle-as-image +set-image-blocker{pattern} -limit-connect 
 +prevent-compression -session-cookies-only -prevent-reading-cookies 
 -prevent-setting-cookies -kill-popups -send-vanilla-wafer -send-wafer
</screen>
</para>

<para>
 Notice the only difference here to the previous listing, is to 
 <quote>fast-redirects</quote> and <quote>session-cookies-only</quote>.
</para>

<para>
 Now another example, <quote>ad.doubleclick.net</quote>:
</para>

<para>
 <screen>

 { +block +handle-as-image }
  .ad.doubleclick.net

 { +block +handle-as-image }
  ad*.

 { +block +handle-as-image }
  .doubleclick.net
</screen>
</para>

<para>
 We'll just show the interesting part here, the explicit matches. It is 
 matched three different times. Each as an <quote>+block +handle-as-image</quote>,
 which is the expanded form of one of our aliases that had been defined as: 
 <quote>+imageblock</quote>. (<ulink
 url="actions-file.html#ALIASES"><quote>Aliases</quote></ulink> are defined in
 the first section of the actions file and typically used to combine more 
 than one action.)
</para>

<para>
 Any one of these would have done the trick and blocked this as an unwanted 
 image. This is unnecessarily redundant since the last case effectively 
 would also cover the first. No point in taking chances with these guys 
 though ;-) Note that if you want an ad or obnoxious 
 URL to be invisible, it should be defined as <quote>ad.doubleclick.net</quote>
 is done here -- as both a <ulink
 url="actions-file.html#BLOCK"><quote>+block</quote></ulink>
 <emphasis>and</emphasis> an 
 <ulink
 url="actions-file.html#HANDLE-AS-IMAGE"><quote>+handle-as-image</quote></ulink>.
 The custom alias <quote>+imageblock</quote> just simplifies the process and make 
 it more readable.
</para>

<para>
 One last example. Let's try <quote>http://www.rhapsodyk.net/adsl/HOWTO/</quote>.
 This one is giving us problems. We are getting a blank page. Hmmm...
</para>

<para>
 <screen>

 Matches for http://www.rhapsodyk.net/adsl/HOWTO/:

 { -add-header -block +deanimate-gifs -downgrade-http-version +fast-redirects 
   +filter{html-annoyances} +filter{js-annoyances} +filter{kill-popups} 
   +filter{webbugs} +filter{nimda} +filter{banners-by-size} +filter{hal} 
   +filter{fun} +hide-forwarded-for-headers +hide-from-header{block} 
   +hide-referer{forge} -hide-user-agent -handle-as-image +set-image-blocker{blank} 
   +prevent-compression +session-cookies-only -prevent-setting-cookies 
   -prevent-reading-cookies +kill-popups -send-vanilla-wafer -send-wafer }
   /

 { +block +handle-as-image }
  /ads
</screen>
</para>

<para>
 Ooops, the <quote>/adsl/</quote> is matching <quote>/ads</quote>! But 
 we did not want this at all! Now we see why we get the blank page. We could
 now add a new action below this that explicitly does <emphasis>not</emphasis>
 block (<quote>{-block}</quote>) paths with <quote>adsl</quote>. There are
 various ways to handle such exceptions. Example:
</para>

<para>
 <screen>

 { -block }
  /adsl
</screen>
</para>

<para>
 Now the page displays ;-) Be sure to flush your browser's caches when 
 making such changes. Or, try using <literal>Shift+Reload</literal>.
</para>

<para>
 But now what about a situation where we get no explicit matches like 
 we did with:
</para>

<para>
 <screen>

 { +block +handle-as-image }
 /ads
</screen>
</para>

<para>
 That actually was very telling and pointed us quickly to where the problem
 was. If you don't get this kind of match, then it means one of the default 
 rules in the first section is causing the problem. This would require some 
 guesswork, and maybe a little trial and error to isolate the offending rule.
 One likely cause would be one of the <quote>{+filter}</quote> actions. Try 
 adding the URL for the site to one of aliases that turn off <quote>+filter</quote>:
</para>

<para>
 <screen>

 {shop}
 .quietpc.com
 .worldpay.com   # for quietpc.com
 .jungle.com
 .scan.co.uk
 .forbes.com
</screen>
</para>

<para>
 <quote>{shop}</quote> is an <quote>alias</quote> that expands to 
 <quote>{ -filter -session-cookies-only }</quote>.
 Or you could do your own exception to negate filtering:

</para>

<para>
 <screen>

 {-filter}
 .forbes.com
</screen>
</para>

<para>
 This would probably be most appropriately put in <filename>user.action</filename>, 
 for local site exceptions.
</para>

<para>
 <quote>{fragile}</quote> is an alias that disables most actions. This can be 
 used as a last resort for problem sites. Remember to flush caches! If this 
 still does not work, you will have to go through the remaining actions one by
 one to find which one(s) is causing the problem.
</para>
