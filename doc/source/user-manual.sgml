<para>
 <application>Privoxy</application> is a web proxy with advanced
 filtering capabilities for protecting privacy, filtering and modifying web
 page content, managing cookies, controlling access, and removing ads,
 banners, pop-ups and other obnoxious Internet Junk.
 <application>Privoxy</application> has a very flexible configuration and
 can be customized to suit individual needs and tastes. <application>Privoxy</application> has application for both stand-alone systems and
 multi-user networks.
</para>

<para>
 This documentation is included with the current BETA version of
 <application>Privoxy</application> and is mostly complete at this
 point. The most up to date reference for the time being is still the comments
 in the source files and in the individual configuration files. Development
 of version 3.0 is currently nearing completion, and includes many significant
 changes and enhancements over earlier versions. The target release date for
 stable v3.0 is <quote>soon</quote> ;-)
</para>

<para>
 Since this is a BETA version, not all new features are well tested. This
 documentation may be slightly out of sync as a result (especially with 
 CVS sources). And there <emphasis>may be</emphasis> bugs, though hopefully
 not many!

<para>
 <application>Privoxy</application> is available as raw source code, or
 pre-compiled binaries. See the <ulink

 for binaries and current release info. <application>Privoxy</application>
 is also available via <ulink

 This is the recommended approach at this time. But please be aware that CVS

  cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.ijbswa.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/ijbswa co current
  cd current
 </screen>
</para>

<para>
 This will create a directory named <filename>current/</filename>, which will 
 contain the source tree.
</para>

<para>
 Then, in either case, to build from tarball/CVS source:
</para>

<para>
 <screen>
 ./configure      (--help to see options)
 make             (the make from gnu, gmake for *BSD) 
 su

<sect2 id="installation-os2"><title>OS/2</title>

<!--
Thanx David Schmidt!
-->

<para>
 <application>Privoxy</application> is packaged in a WarpIN self-
 installing archive.  The self-installing program will be named depending
 on the release version, something like:
 <filename>ijbos2_setup_1.2.3.exe</filename>.  In order to install it, simply
 run this executable or double-click on its icon and follow the WarpIN
 installation panels.  A shadow of the <application>Privoxy</application>
 executable will be placed in your startup folder so it will start 
 automatically whenever OS/2 starts.
</para>

<para>
 The directory you choose to install <application>Privoxy</application>
 into will contain all of the configuration files.
</para>

<para>
 If you would like to build binary images on OS/2 yourself, you will need
 a few Unix-like tools: autoconf, autoheader and sh.  These tools will be
 used to create the required config.h file, which is not part of the 
 source distribution because it differs based on platform.  You will also
 need a compiler.
 The distribution has been created using IBM VisualAge compilers, but you
 can use any compiler you like.  GCC/EMX has the disadvantage of needing 
 to be single-threaded due to a limitation of EMX's implementation of the
 select() socket call.
</para>

<para>
 In addition to needing the source code distribution as outlined earlier,
 you will want to extract the <filename>os2seutp</filename> directory from CVS:
 <screen>
 cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.ijbswa.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/ijbswa login          
 cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.ijbswa.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/ijbswa co os2setup
 </screen>
 This will create a directory named os2setup/, which will contain the
 <filename>Makefile.vac</filename> makefile and <filename>os2build.cmd</filename>
 which is used to completely create the binary distribution.  The sequence
 of events for building the executable for yourself goes something like this:
 <screen>
 cd current
 autoheader
 autoconf
 sh configure
 cd ..\os2setup
 nmake -f Makefile.vac
 </screen>
 You will see this sequence laid out in <filename>os2build.cmd</filename>.
</para>

 <para>
  All <application>Privoxy</application> configuration is kept 
  in text files. These files can be edited with a text editor.
  Many important aspects of <application>Privoxy</application> can 
  also be controlled easily with a web browser.

 </para>


<!--   ~~~~~       New section      ~~~~~     -->

<sect2>
<title>Controlling <application>Privoxy</application> with Your Web Browser</title>
<para>
 <application>Privoxy</application> can be reached by the special 
 URL <ulink url="http://p.p/">http://p.p/</ulink> (or alternately
 <ulink url="http://ijbswa.sourceforge.net/config/">http://ijbswa.sourceforge.net/config/</ulink>), 
 which is an internal page. You will see the following section:

</para>

<para>
 <screen>

Please choose from the following options:

    * Show information about the current configuration
    * Show the source code version numbers
    * Show the client's request headers.
    * Show which actions apply to a URL and why
    * Toggle Privoxy on or off
    * Edit the actions list

 </screen>
</para>

<para>
 This should be self-explanatory. Note the last item is an editor for the
 <quote>actions list</quote>, which is where much of the ad, banner, cookie,
 and URL blocking magic is configured as well as other advanced features of
 <application>Privoxy</application>. This is an easy way to adjust various
 aspects of <application>Privoxy</application> configuration. The actions
 file, and other configuration files, are explained in detail below. 
 <application>Privoxy</application> will automatically detect any changes 
 to these files.
</para>

<para>
 <quote>Toggle Privoxy On or Off</quote> is handy for sites that might 
 have problems with your current actions and filters, or just to test if 
 a site misbehaves, whether it is <application>Privoxy</application> 
 causing the problem or not. <application>Privoxy</application> continues 
 to run as a proxy in this case, but all filtering is disabled.

</para>

</sect2>

<!--  ~  End section  ~  -->




<!--   ~~~~~       New section      ~~~~~     -->

<sect2>
<title>Configuration Files Overview</title>
<para>
 For Unix, *BSD and Linux, all configuration files are located in
 <filename>/etc/privoxy/</filename> by default. For MS Windows, OS/2, and
 AmigaOS these are all in the same directory as the 
 <application>Privoxy</application> executable. The name and number of
 configuration files has changed from previous versions, and is subject to
 change as development progresses.
</para>

<para>
 The installed defaults provide a reasonable starting point, though possibly
 aggressive by some standards. For the time being, there are only three
 default configuration files (this will change in time):
</para>

<para>
 <itemizedlist>

  <listitem>
   <para>
     The main configuration file is named <filename>config</filename>
     on Linux, Unix, BSD, OS/2, and AmigaOS and <filename>config.txt</filename>
     on Windows.
   </para>
  </listitem> 

  <listitem>
   <para>
    The <filename>default.action</filename> file is used  to define various 
    <quote>actions</quote> relating to images, banners, pop-ups, access
    restrictions, banners and cookies. There is a CGI based editor for this
    file that can be accessed via <ulink
    url="http://p.p">http://p.p</ulink>. (Other actions 
    files are included as well with differing levels of filtering 
    and blocking, e.g. <filename>ijb-basic.action</filename>.)
   </para>
  </listitem> 

  <listitem>
   <para>
    The <filename>default.filter</filename> file can be used to re-write the raw
    page content, including viewable text as well as embedded HTML and JavaScript,
    and whatever else lurks on any given web page.
   </para>
  </listitem> 

 </itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>
 <filename>default.action</filename> and <filename>default.filter</filename> 
 can use Perl style regular expressions for maximum flexibility. All files use
 the <quote><literal>#</literal></quote> character to denote a comment. Such
 lines are not processed by <application>Privoxy</application>. After
 making any changes, there is no need to restart
 <application>Privoxy</application> in order for the changes to take
 effect. <application>Privoxy</application> should detect such changes 
 automatically.
</para>

<para>
 While under development, the configuration content is subject to change. 
 The below documentation may not be accurate by the time you read this. 
 Also, what constitutes a <quote>default</quote> setting, may change, so 
 please check all your configuration files on important issues.
</para>
</sect2>


<!--   ~~~~~       New section      ~~~~~     -->

<sect2>
<title>The Main Configuration File</title>
<para>
 Again, the main configuration file is named <filename>config</filename> on
 Linux/Unix/BSD and OS/2, and <filename>config.txt</filename> on Windows.
 Configuration lines consist of an initial keyword followed by a list of
 values, all separated by whitespace (any number of spaces or tabs). For
 example:
</para>

<para>
 <literal>
  <msgtext> 
   <literallayout>
  <emphasis>blockfile blocklist.ini</emphasis>
   </literallayout>
  </msgtext> 
 </literal>
</para>

<para>
 Indicates that the blockfile is named <quote>blocklist.ini</quote>. (A 
 default installation does not use this.)
</para>

<para>
 A <quote><literal>#</literal></quote> indicates a comment.  Any part of a
 line following a <quote><literal>#</literal></quote> is ignored, except if
 the <quote><literal>#</literal></quote> is preceded by a
 <quote><literal>\</literal></quote>.
</para>

<para>
 Thus, by placing a <quote><literal>#</literal></quote> at the start of an
 existing configuration line, you can make it a comment and it will be treated
 as if it weren't there. This is called <quote>commenting out</quote> an
 option and can be useful to turn off features: If you comment out the
 <quote>logfile</quote> line, <application>Privoxy</application> will not
 log to a file at all. Watch for the <quote>default:</quote> section in each
 explanation to see what happens if the option is left unset (or commented
 out). 
</para>

<para>
 Long lines can be continued on the next line by using a
 <quote><literal>\</literal></quote> as the very last character.
</para>

<para>
 There are various aspects of <application>Privoxy</application> behavior 
 that can be tuned.
</para>


<!--   ~~~~~       New section      ~~~~~     -->

<sect3>
<title>Defining Other Configuration Files</title>

<para>
 <application>Privoxy</application> can use a number of other files to tell it
 what ads to block, what cookies to accept, etc.  This section of the
 configuration file tells <application>Privoxy</application> where to find
 all those other files. 
</para>

<para>
 On <application>Windows</application> and <application>AmigaOS</application>,
 <application>Privoxy</application> looks for these files in the same
 directory as the executable.  On Unix and  OS/2,
 <application>Privoxy</application> looks for these files in the current
 working directory. In either case, an absolute path name can be used to
 avoid problems.
</para>

<para>
 When development goes modular and multi-user, the blocker, filter, and
 per-user config will be stored in subdirectories of <quote>confdir</quote>.
 For now, only <filename>confdir/templates</filename> is used for storing HTML
 templates for CGI results. 
</para>

<para>
 The location of the configuration files:
</para>

<para>
 <literal>
  <msgtext> 
   <literallayout>
  <emphasis>confdir  /etc/privoxy</emphasis>       # No trailing /, please.
   </literallayout>
  </msgtext> 
 </literal>
</para>

<para>
 The directory where all logging (i.e. <filename>logfile</filename> and 
 <filename>jarfile</filename>) takes place. No trailing
 <quote><literal>/</literal></quote>, please: 
</para>

<para>
 <literal>
  <msgtext> 
   <literallayout>
  <emphasis>logdir  /var/log/privoxy</emphasis>
   </literallayout>
  </msgtext> 
 </literal>
</para>

<para>
 Note that all file specifications below are relative to 
 the above two directories!
</para>

<para>
 The <quote>default.action</quote> file contains patterns to specify the actions
 to apply to requests for each site. Default: Cookies to and from all
 destinations are kept only during the current browser session (i.e. they are
 not saved to disk). Pop-ups are disabled for all sites. All sites are
 filtered through selected sections of <quote>default.filter</quote>. No sites
 are blocked. The <application>Privoxy</application> logo is displayed for
 filtered ads and other images. The syntax of this file is explained in detail
 <link linkend="actionsfile">below</link>. Other <quote>actions</quote> files
 are included, and you are free to use any of them. They have varying degrees
 of aggressiveness.
</para>

<para>
 <literal>
  <msgtext> 
   <literallayout>
  <emphasis>actionsfile  default.action</emphasis>
   </literallayout>
  </msgtext> 
 </literal>
</para>

<para>
 The <quote>default.filter</quote> file contains content modification rules 
 that use <quote>regular expressions</quote>. These rules permit powerful
 changes on the content of Web pages, e.g., you could disable your favorite
 JavaScript annoyances, re-write the actual displayed text, or just have some
 fun replacing <quote>Microsoft</quote> with <quote>MicroSuck</quote> wherever
 it appears on a Web page. Default: whatever the developers are playing with
 :-/
</para>

<para>
 Filtering requires buffering the page content, which may appear to slow down
 page rendering since nothing is displayed until all content has passed 
 the filters. (It does not really take longer, but seems that way since 
 the page is not incrementally displayed.) This effect will be more noticeable
 on slower connections.

</para>

 <literal>
  <msgtext> 
   <literallayout>
  <emphasis>filterfile  default.filter</emphasis>

</para>

<para>
 The logfile is where all logging and error messages are written. The logfile
 can be useful for tracking down a problem with
 <application>Privoxy</application> (e.g., it's not blocking an ad you
 think it should block) but in most cases you probably will never look at it.
</para>

<para>
 Your logfile will grow indefinitely, and you will probably want to
 periodically remove it.  On Unix systems, you can do this with a cron job
 (see <quote>man cron</quote>). For Redhat, a <command>logrotate</command> 
 script has been included.
</para>

<para>
 On SuSE Linux systems, you can place a line like <quote>/var/log/privoxy.*
 +1024k 644 nobody.nogroup</quote> in <filename>/etc/logfiles</filename>, with
 the effect that cron.daily will automatically archive, gzip, and empty the
 log, when it exceeds 1M size.
</para>

<para>
 Default: Log to the a file named <filename>logfile</filename>. 
 Comment out to disable logging.
</para>

<para>

   <literallayout>
  <emphasis>logfile  logfile</emphasis>
   </literallayout>
  </msgtext> 
 </literal>
</para>

<para>
 The <quote>jarfile</quote> defines where
 <application>Privoxy</application> stores the cookies it intercepts.  Note
 that if you use a <quote>jarfile</quote>, it may grow quite large. Default:
 Don't store intercepted cookies.
</para>

<para>
 <literal>
  <msgtext> 
   <literallayout>
  <emphasis>#jarfile  jarfile</emphasis>
   </literallayout>
  </msgtext> 
 </literal>
</para>

<para>
 If you specify a <quote>trustfile</quote>,
 <application>Privoxy</application> will only allow access to sites that
 are named in the trustfile. You can also mark sites as trusted referrers,
 with the effect that access to untrusted sites will be granted, if a link
 from a trusted referrer was used. The link target will then be added to the
 <quote>trustfile</quote>. This is a very restrictive feature that typical
 users most probably want to leave disabled. Default: Disabled, don't use the
 trust mechanism.
</para>

<para>
 <literal>
  <msgtext>

  <emphasis>#trustfile  trust</emphasis>

 This part of the configuration file contains options that control how
 <application>Privoxy</application> operates.
</para>

<para>
 <quote>Admin-address</quote> should be set to the email address of the proxy
 administrator. It is used in many of the proxy-generated pages. Default:

<para>
 <quote>Proxy-info-url</quote> can be set to a URL that contains more info
 about this <application>Privoxy</application> installation, it's
 configuration and policies. It is used in many of the proxy-generated pages
 and its use is highly recommended in multi-user installations, since your
 users will want to know why certain content is blocked or modified. Default:
 Don't show a link to on-line documentation.

</para>

<para>
 <quote>Listen-address</quote> specifies the address and port where
 <application>Privoxy</application> will listen for connections from your
 Web browser.  The default is to listen on the localhost port 8118, and
 this is suitable for most users.  (In your web browser, under proxy
 configuration, list the proxy server as <quote>localhost</quote> and the
 port as <quote>8118</quote>).
</para>

<para>
 If you already have another service running on port 8118, or if you want to
 serve requests from other machines (e.g. on your local network) as well, you
 will need to override the default. The syntax is 
 <quote>listen-address [&lt;ip-address&gt;]:&lt;port&gt;</quote>. If you leave
 out the IP address, <application>Privoxy</application> will bind to all
 interfaces (addresses) on your machine and may become reachable from the
 Internet. In that case, consider using access control lists (acl's) (see
 <quote>aclfile</quote> above), or a firewall.
</para>

<para>
 For example, suppose you are running <application>Privoxy</application> on
 a machine which has the address 192.168.0.1 on your local private network
 (192.168.0.0) and has another outside connection with a different address.
 You want it to serve requests from inside only:

</para>

<para>
 If you do this, consider using ACLs (see <quote>aclfile</quote> above). Note:
 you will need to point your browser(s) to the address and port that you have
 configured here. Default: localhost:8118 (127.0.0.1:8118).
</para>

<para>
 The debug option sets the level of debugging information to log in the
 logfile (and to the console in the Windows version).  A debug level of 1 is
 informative because it will show you each request as it happens.  Higher
 levels of debug are probably only of interest to developers.

 <application>Privoxy</application> normally uses
 <quote>multi-threading</quote>, a software technique that permits it to
 handle many different requests simultaneously. In some cases you may wish to
 disable this -- particularly if you're trying to debug a problem.  The

</para>

<para>
 The Windows version of <application>Privoxy</application> puts an icon in
 the system tray, which also allows you to change this option.  If you
 right-click on that icon (or select the <quote>Options</quote> menu), one
 choice is <quote>Enable</quote>. Clicking on enable toggles
 <application>Privoxy</application> on and off. This is useful if you want
 to temporarily disable <application>Privoxy</application>, e.g., to access
 a site that requires cookies which you would otherwise have blocked. This can also
 be toggled via a web browser at the <application>Privoxy</application>
 internal address of <ulink url="http://p.p">http://p.p</ulink> on 
 any platform.
</para>

<para>
 <quote>toggle 1</quote> means <application>Privoxy</application> runs

 For content filtering, i.e. the <quote>+filter</quote> and
 <quote>+deanimate-gif</quote> actions, it is necessary that 
 <application>Privoxy</application> buffers the entire document body.
 This can be potentially dangerous, since a server could just keep sending
 data indefinitely and wait for your RAM to exhaust. With nasty consequences.
</para>

<para>
 The <application>buffer-limit</application> option lets you set the maximum
 size in Kbytes that each buffer may use. When the documents buffer exceeds
 this size, it is flushed to the client unfiltered and no further attempt to
 filter the rest of it is made. Remember that there may multiple threads
 running, which might require increasing the <quote>buffer-limit</quote>
 Kbytes <emphasis>each</emphasis>, unless you have enabled

<title>Access Control List (ACL)</title>
<para>
 Access controls are included at the request of some ISPs and systems
 administrators, and are not usually needed by individual users. Please note
 the warnings in the FAQ that this proxy is not intended to be a substitute
 for a firewall or to encourage anyone to defer addressing basic security
 weaknesses.
</para>

<para>
 If no access settings are specified, the proxy talks to anyone that
 connects. If any access settings file are specified, then the proxy
 talks only to IP addresses permitted somewhere in this file and not
 denied later in this file.
</para>

<para>
 Summary -- if using an ACL:
</para>

 <simplelist>
  <member>
   Client must have permission to receive service.
  </member>
 </simplelist>
 <simplelist>
  <member>
   LAST match in ACL wins.
  </member>
 </simplelist>
 <simplelist>
  <member>
   Default behavior is to deny service.
  </member>
 </simplelist>

 <emphasis>SRC_MASKLEN</emphasis> = number of bits in the subnet mask for the source

 <emphasis>DST_ADDR</emphasis>    = server or forwarder hostname or dotted IP address
 <emphasis>DST_MASKLEN</emphasis> = number of bits in the subnet mask for the target
   </literallayout>
  </msgtext> 
 </literal>
</para>


<para> 
 The field separator (FS) is whitespace (space or tab).
</para>

<para>
 IMPORTANT NOTE: If <application>Privoxy</application> is using a
 forwarder (see below) or a gateway for a particular destination URL, the
 <literal>DST_ADDR</literal> that is examined is the address of the forwarder
 or the gateway and <emphasis>NOT</emphasis> the address of the ultimate
 target. This is necessary because it may be impossible for the local
 <application>Privoxy</application> to determine the address of the
 ultimate target (that's often what gateways are used for).
</para>

<para>
 Here are a few examples to show how the ACL features work:
</para>

<para>
 <quote>localhost</quote> is OK -- no DST_ADDR implies that
 <emphasis>ALL</emphasis> destination addresses are OK:

<title>Forwarding</title>

<para>
 This feature allows chaining of HTTP requests via multiple proxies.
 It can be used to better protect privacy and confidentiality when
 accessing specific domains by routing requests to those domains
 to a special purpose filtering proxy such as lpwa.com. Or to use 
 a caching proxy to speed up browsing.
</para>

<para>
 It can also be used in an environment with multiple networks to route
 requests via multiple gateways allowing transparent access to multiple
 networks without having to modify browser configurations.
</para>

<para>
 Also specified here are SOCKS proxies. <application>Privoxy</application>
 SOCKS 4 and SOCKS 4A. The difference is that SOCKS 4A will resolve the target

<sect2 id="actionsfile">
<title>The Actions File</title>

<para>
 The <quote>default.action</quote> file (formerly
 <filename>actionsfile</filename>) is used to define what actions
 <application>Privoxy</application> takes, and thus determines how images,
 cookies and various other aspects of HTTP content and transactions are
 handled. Images can be anything you want, including ads, banners, or just
 some obnoxious URL that you would rather not see. Cookies can be accepted
 or rejected, or accepted only during the current browser session (i.e. 
 not written to disk). Changes to <filename>default.action</filename> should 
 be immediately visible to <application>Privoxy</application> without 
 the need to restart.
</para>

<para>
 The easiest way to edit <quote>actions</quote> file is with a browser by
 loading <ulink url="http://p.p/">http://p.p/</ulink>, and then select
 <quote>Edit Actions List</quote>. A text editor can also be used.
</para>

<para>
 To determine which actions apply to a request, the URL of the request is
 compared to all patterns in this file. Every time it matches, the list of
 applicable actions for the URL is incrementally updated. You can trace
 this process by visiting <ulink
 url="http://p.p/show-url-info">http://p.p/show-url-info</ulink>. 
</para>


<para>
 There are four types of lines in this file: comments (begin with a 
 <quote>#</quote> character), actions, aliases and patterns, all of which are
 explained below, as well as the configuration file syntax that 
 <application>Privoxy</application> understands.

</para>


<!--   ~~~~~       New section      ~~~~~     -->
<sect3>
<title>URL Domain and Path Syntax</title>
<para>
 Generally, a pattern has the form &lt;domain&gt;/&lt;path&gt;, where both the
 &lt;domain&gt; and &lt;path&gt; part are optional. If you only specify a
 domain part, the <quote>/</quote> can be left out:
</para>

<para>
 <emphasis>www.example.com</emphasis> - is a domain only pattern and will match any request to
 <quote>www.example.com</quote>.
</para>

<para>
 <emphasis>www.example.com/</emphasis> - means exactly the same.
</para>

<para>
 <emphasis>www.example.com/index.html</emphasis> - matches only the single
 document <quote>/index.html</quote> on <quote>www.example.com</quote>.
</para>

<para>
 <emphasis>/index.html</emphasis> - matches the document <quote>/index.html</quote>, regardless of
 the domain.
</para>

<para>
 <emphasis>index.html</emphasis> - matches nothing, since it would be
 interpreted as a domain name and there is no top-level domain called
 <quote>.html</quote>.
</para>

<para>
 The matching of the domain part offers some flexible options: if the
 domain starts or ends with a dot, it becomes unanchored at that end. 
 For example:
</para>

<para>
 <emphasis>.example.com</emphasis> - matches any domain that <emphasis>ENDS</emphasis> in 
 <quote>.example.com</quote>.
</para>

<para>
 <emphasis>www.</emphasis> - matches any domain that <emphasis>STARTS</emphasis> with
 <quote>www</quote>.
</para>

<para>
 Additionally, there are wild-cards that you can use in the domain names
 themselves. They work pretty similar to shell wild-cards: <quote>*</quote>
 stands for zero or more arbitrary characters, <quote>?</quote> stands for
 any single character. And you can define character classes in square
 brackets and they can be freely mixed:
</para>

<para>
 <emphasis>ad*.example.com</emphasis> - matches <quote>adserver.example.com</quote>, 
 <quote>ads.example.com</quote>, etc but not <quote>sfads.example.com</quote>.
</para>

<para>
 <emphasis>*ad*.example.com</emphasis> - matches all of the above, and then some.
</para>

<para>
 <emphasis>.?pix.com</emphasis> - matches <quote>www.ipix.com</quote>,
 <quote>pictures.epix.com</quote>, <quote>a.b.c.d.e.upix.com</quote>, etc. 
</para>

<para>
 <emphasis>www[1-9a-ez].example.com</emphasis> - matches <quote>www1.example.com</quote>, 
 <quote>www4.example.com</quote>, <quote>wwwd.example.com</quote>, 
 <quote>wwwz.example.com</quote>, etc., but <emphasis>not</emphasis> 
 <quote>wwww.example.com</quote>.
</para>

<para>
 If <application>Privoxy</application> was compiled with
 <quote>pcre</quote> support (default), Perl compatible regular expressions
 can be used. See the <filename>pcre/docs/</filename> directory or <quote>man
 perlre</quote> (also available on  <ulink
 url="http://www.perldoc.com/perl5.6/pod/perlre.html">http://www.perldoc.com/perl5.6/pod/perlre.html</ulink>)
 for details. A brief discussion of regular expressions is in the 
 <link linkend="regex">Appendix</link>. For instance:
</para>

<para>
 <emphasis>/.*/advert[0-9]+\.jpe?g</emphasis>  - would match a URL from any
 domain, with any path that includes <quote>advert</quote> followed
 immediately by one or more digits, then a <quote>.</quote> and ending in
 either <quote>jpeg</quote> or <quote>jpg</quote>. So we match
 <quote>example.com/ads/advert2.jpg</quote>, and
 <quote>www.example.com/ads/banners/advert39.jpeg</quote>, but not
 <quote>www.example.com/ads/banners/advert39.gif</quote> (no gifs in the
 example pattern).
</para>

<para>
 Please note that matching in the path is case
 <emphasis>INSENSITIVE</emphasis> by default, but you can switch to case
 sensitive at any point in the pattern by using the 
 <quote>(?-i)</quote> switch:
</para>

<para>
 <emphasis>www.example.com/(?-i)PaTtErN.*</emphasis> - will match only
 documents whose path starts with <quote>PaTtErN</quote> in
 <emphasis>exactly</emphasis> this capitalization.
</para>

<title>Actions</title>
<para>
 Actions are enabled if preceded with a <quote>+</quote>, and disabled if 
 preceded with a <quote>-</quote>. Actions are invoked by enclosing the 
 action name in curly braces (e.g. {+some_action}), followed by a list of 
 URLs to which the action applies. There are three classes of actions:

   Many sites, like yahoo.com, don't just link to other sites. Instead, they
   will link to some script on their own server, giving the destination as a
   parameter, which will then redirect you to the final target. URLs resulting
   from this scheme typically look like:
   http://some.place/some_script?http://some.where-else.
  </para>
  <para>
   Sometimes, there are even multiple consecutive redirects encoded in the
   URL. These redirections via scripts make your web browsing more traceable,
   since the server from which you follow such a link can see where you go to.
   Apart from that, valuable bandwidth and time is wasted, while your browser
   ask the server for one redirect after the other. Plus, it feeds the
   advertisers.
  </para>
  <para>
   The <quote>+fast-redirects</quote> option enables interception of these
   requests by <application>Privoxy</application>, who will cut off all but
   the last valid URL in the request and send a local redirect back to your
   browser without contacting the remote site.

   By default (i.e. in the absence of a <quote>+limit-connect</quote>

  <para>
   The CONNECT methods exists in HTTP to allow access to secure websites
   (https:// URLs) through proxies. It works very simply: the proxy

 Note that many of these actions have the potential to cause a page to
 misbehave, possibly even not to display at all. There are many ways 
 a site designer may choose to design his site, and what HTTP header 
 content he may depend on. There is no way to have hard and fast rules 
 for all sites. See the <link linkend="ACTIONSANAT">Appendix</link>
 for a brief example on troubleshooting actions.

<title>Aliases</title>
<para>
 Custom <quote>actions</quote>, known to <application>Privoxy</application>
 as <quote>aliases</quote>, can be defined by combining other <quote>actions</quote>.
 These can in turn be invoked just like the built-in <quote>actions</quote>.
 Currently, an alias can contain any character except space, tab, <quote>=</quote>,
 <quote>{</quote> or <quote>}</quote>. But please use only <quote>a</quote>-
 <quote>z</quote>, <quote>0</quote>-<quote>9</quote>, <quote>+</quote>, and
 <quote>-</quote>. Alias names are not case sensitive, and 
 <emphasis>must be defined  before anything</emphasis> else in the
 <filename>default.action</filename>file ! And there can only be one set of
 <quote>aliases</quote> defined.

<title>The Filter File</title>
<para>
 Any web page can be dynamically modified with the filter file. This
 modification can be removal, or re-writing, of any web page content,
 including tags and non-visible content. The default filter file is
 <filename>default.filter</filename>, located in the config directory. 
</para>

<para>
 The included example file is divided into sections. Each section begins 
 with the <literal>FILTER</literal> keyword, followed by the identifier 
 for that section, e.g. <quote>FILTER: webbugs</quote>. Each section performs
 a similar type of filtering, such as <quote>html-annoyances</quote>.

</para>

<para>
 This file uses regular expressions to alter or remove any string in the
 target page. The expressions can only operate on one line at a time. Some

<title>Templates</title>
<para>
 When <application>Privoxy</application> displays one of its internal 
 pages, such as a 404 Not Found error page, it uses the appropriate template.
 On Linux, BSD, and Unix, these are located in
 <filename>/etc/privoxy/templates</filename> by default. These may be
 customized, if desired.

<sect1 id="quickstart"><title>Quickstart to Using <application>Privoxy</application></title>
<para>
 Install package, then run and enjoy! <application>Privoxy</application> 
 is typically started by specifying the main configuration file to be 
 used on the command line. Example Unix startup command:
</para>

<para>
 <screen>
 
 # /usr/sbin/privoxy /etc/privoxy/config
 
 </screen>
</para>

<para>
 An init script is provided for SuSE and Redhat.
</para>

<para>
For for SuSE: /etc/rc.d/privoxy start
</para>

<para>
For RedHat: /etc/rc.d/init.d/privoxy start
</para>


<para>
 If no configuration file is specified on the command line,
 <application>Privoxy</application> will look for a file named
 <filename>config</filename> in the current directory. Except on Win32 where
 it will try <filename>config.txt</filename>. If no file is specified on the
 command line and no default configuration file can be found, 
 <application>Privoxy</application> will fail to start.
</para>

<para>
 Be sure your browser is set to use the proxy which is by default at
 localhost, port 8118. With <application>Netscape</application> (and
 <application>Mozilla</application>), this can be set under <literal>Edit
 -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Proxies -&gt; HTTP Proxy</literal>.
 For <application>Internet Explorer</application>: <literal>Tools &gt;
 Internet Properties -&gt; Connections -&gt; LAN Setting</literal>. Then,
 check <quote>Use Proxy</quote> and fill in the appropriate info (Address:
 localhost, Port: 8118). Include if HTTPS proxy support too.
</para>

<para>
 The included default configuration files should give a reasonable starting
 point, though may be somewhat aggressive in blocking junk. You will probably
 want to keep an eye out for sites that require persistent cookies, and add these to
 <filename>default.action</filename> as needed. By default, most of these will
 be accepted only during the current browser session, until you add them to
 the configuration. If you want the browser to handle this instead, you will
 need to edit <filename>default.action</filename> and disable this feature. If you
 use more than one browser, it would make more sense to let
 <application>Privoxy</application> handle this. In which case, the
 browser(s) should be set to accept all cookies.
</para>

<para>
 If a particular site shows problems loading properly, try adding it 
 to the <literal>{fragile}</literal> section of
 <filename>default.action</filename>. This will turn off most actions for 
 this site.
</para>

<para>
 <application>Privoxy</application> is HTTP/1.1 compliant,  but not all 1.1
 features are as yet implemented. If browsers that support HTTP/1.1 (like
 <application>Mozilla</application> or recent versions of I.E.) experience
 problems, you might try to force HTTP/1.0 compatibility. For Mozilla, look
 under <literal>Edit -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Debug -&gt; Networking</literal>.
 Or set the <quote>+downgrade</quote> config option in
 <filename>default.action</filename>.
</para>

<para>
 After running <application>Privoxy</application> for a while, you can 
 start to fine tune the configuration to suit your personal, or site, 
 preferences and requirements. There are many, many aspects that can 
 be customized. <quote>Actions</quote> (as specified in <filename>default.action</filename>) 
 can be adjusted by pointing your browser to 
 <ulink url="http://p.p/">http://p.p/</ulink>, 
 and then follow the link to <quote>edit the actions list</quote>. 
 (This is an internal page and does not require Internet access.)
</para>

<para>
 In fact, various aspects of <application>Privoxy</application>
 configuration can be viewed from this page, including 
 current configuration parameters, source code version numbers, 
 the browser's request headers, and <quote>actions</quote> that apply 
 to a given URL. In addition to the <filename>default.action</filename> file 
 editor mentioned above, <application>Privoxy</application> can also 
 be turned <quote>on</quote> and <quote>off</quote> from this page.
</para>

<para>
 If you encounter problems, please verify it is a
 <application>Privoxy</application> bug, by disabling
 <application>Privoxy</application>, and then trying the same page. 
 Also, try another browser if possible to eliminate browser or site 
 problems. Before reporting it as a bug, see if there is not a configuration 
 option that is enabled that is causing the page not to load. You can 
 then add an exception for that page or site. If a bug, please report it to
 the developers (see below).

<title>Regular Expressions</title>
<para>
 <application>Privoxy</application> can use <quote>regular expressions</quote> 
 in various config files. Assuming support for <quote>pcre</quote> (Perl
 Compatible Regular Expressions) is compiled in, which is the default. Such
 configuration directives do not require regular expressions, but they can be
 used to increase flexibility by matching a pattern with wild-cards against
 URLs.
</para>

<para>
 If you are reading this, you probably don't understand what <quote>regular
 expressions</quote> are, or what they can do. So this will be a very brief
 introduction only. A full explanation would require a book ;-)
</para>

<para>
 <quote>Regular expressions</quote> is a way of matching one character
 expression against another to see if it matches or not. One of the
 <quote>expressions</quote> is a literal string of readable characters
 (letter, numbers, etc), and the other is a complex string of literal
 characters combined with wild-cards, and other special characters, called
 meta-characters. The <quote>meta-characters</quote> have special meanings and
 are used to build the complex pattern to be matched against. Perl Compatible
 Regular Expressions is an enhanced form of the regular expression language
 with backward compatibility.
</para>

<para>
 To make a simple analogy, we do something similar when we use wild-card
 characters when listing files with the <command>dir</command> command in DOS. 
 <literal>*.*</literal> matches all filenames. The <quote>special</quote>
 character here is the asterisk which matches any and all characters. We can be
 more specific and use <literal>?</literal> to match just individual
 characters. So <quote>dir file?.text</quote> would match
 <quote>file1.txt</quote>, <quote>file2.txt</quote>, etc. We are pattern
 matching, using a similar technique to <quote>regular expressions</quote>!
</para>

<para>
 Regular expressions do essentially the same thing, but are much, much more
 powerful. There are many more <quote>special characters</quote> and ways of 
 building complex patterns however. Let's look at a few of the common ones,
 and then some examples:
</para>

<simplelist>
 <member>
  <emphasis>.</emphasis> - Matches any single character, e.g. <quote>a</quote>,
  <quote>A</quote>, <quote>4</quote>, <quote>:</quote>, or <quote>@</quote>.
 </member>
</simplelist>

<simplelist>
 <member>
  <emphasis>?</emphasis> - The preceding character or expression is matched ZERO or ONE
  times. Either/or.
 </member>
</simplelist>

<simplelist>
 <member>
  <emphasis>+</emphasis> - The preceding character or expression is matched ONE or MORE
  times.
 </member>
</simplelist>

<simplelist>
 <member>
  <emphasis>*</emphasis> - The preceding character or expression is matched ZERO or MORE
  times.
 </member>
</simplelist>

<simplelist>
 <member>
  <emphasis>\</emphasis> - The <quote>escape</quote> character denotes that
  the following character should be taken literally. This is used where one of the 
  special characters (e.g. <quote>.</quote>) needs to be taken literally and
  not as a special meta-character.
 </member>
</simplelist>

<simplelist>
 <member>
  <emphasis>[]</emphasis> - Characters enclosed in brackets will be matched if
  any of the enclosed characters are encountered.
 </member>
</simplelist>

<simplelist>
 <member>
  <emphasis>()</emphasis> - parentheses are used to group a sub-expression,
  or multiple sub-expressions.
 </member>
</simplelist>

<simplelist>
 <member>
  <emphasis>|</emphasis> - The <quote>bar</quote> character works like an
  <quote>or</quote> conditional statement. A match is successful if the
  sub-expression on either side of <quote>|</quote> matches.
 </member>
</simplelist>

<simplelist>
 <member>
  <emphasis>s/string1/string2/g</emphasis> - This is used to rewrite strings of text. 
  <quote>string1</quote> is replaced by <quote>string2</quote> in this
  example.
 </member>
</simplelist>

<para>
 These are just some of the ones you are likely to use when matching URLs with 
 <application>Privoxy</application>, and is a long way from a definitive
 list. This is enough to get us started with a few simple examples which may
 be more illuminating:
</para>

<para>
 <emphasis><literal>/.*/banners/.*</literal></emphasis> - A  simple example
 that uses the common combination of <quote>.</quote> and <quote>*</quote> to 
 denote any character, zero or more times. In other words, any string at all.
 So we start with a literal forward slash, then our regular expression pattern 
 (<quote>.*</quote>) another literal forward slash, the string
 <quote>banners</quote>, another forward slash, and lastly another
 <quote>.*</quote>. We are building 
 a directory path here. This will match any file with the path that has a
 directory named <quote>banners</quote> in it. The <quote>.*</quote> matches
 any characters, and this could conceivably be more forward slashes, so it
 might expand into a much longer looking path. For example, this could match:
 <quote>/eye/hate/spammers/banners/annoy_me_please.gif</quote>, or just
 <quote>/banners/annoying.html</quote>, or almost an infinite number of other
 possible combinations, just so it has <quote>banners</quote> in the path
 somewhere.
</para>

<para>
 A now something a little more complex:
</para>

<para>
 <emphasis><literal>/.*/adv((er)?ts?|ertis(ing|ements?))?/</literal></emphasis> - 
 We have several literal forward slashes again (<quote>/</quote>), so we are
 building another expression that is a file path statement. We have another 
 <quote>.*</quote>, so we are matching against any conceivable sub-path, just so
 it matches our expression. The only true literal that <emphasis>must
 match</emphasis> our pattern is <application>adv</application>, together with
 the forward slashes. What comes after the <quote>adv</quote> string is the
 interesting part. 
</para>

<para>
 Remember the <quote>?</quote> means the preceding expression (either a
 literal character or anything grouped with <quote>(...)</quote> in this case)
 can exist or not, since this means either zero or one match. So
 <quote>((er)?ts?|ertis(ing|ements?))</quote> is optional, as are the
 individual sub-expressions: <quote>(er)</quote>,
 <quote>(ing|ements?)</quote>, and the <quote>s</quote>. The <quote>|</quote>
 means <quote>or</quote>. We have two of those. For instance, 
 <quote>(ing|ements?)</quote>, can expand to match either <quote>ing</quote> 
 <emphasis>OR</emphasis> <quote>ements?</quote>. What is being done here, is an
 attempt at matching as many variations of <quote>advertisement</quote>, and 
 similar, as possible. So this would expand to match just <quote>adv</quote>,
 or <quote>advert</quote>, or <quote>adverts</quote>, or
 <quote>advertising</quote>, or <quote>advertisement</quote>, or
 <quote>advertisements</quote>. You get the idea. But it would not match 
 <quote>advertizements</quote> (with a <quote>z</quote>). We could fix that by
 changing our regular expression to: 
 <quote>/.*/adv((er)?ts?|erti(s|z)(ing|ements?))?/</quote>, which would then match
 either spelling.
</para>

<para>
 <emphasis><literal>/.*/advert[0-9]+\.(gif|jpe?g)</literal></emphasis> - Again 
 another path statement with forward slashes. Anything in the square brackets 
 <quote>[]</quote> can be matched. This is using <quote>0-9</quote> as a
 shorthand expression to mean any digit one through nine. It is the same as
 saying <quote>0123456789</quote>. So any digit matches. The <quote>+</quote>
 means one or more of the preceding expression must be included. The preceding 
 expression here is what is in the square brackets -- in this case, any digit 
 one through nine. Then, at the end, we have a grouping: <quote>(gif|jpe?g)</quote>. 
 This includes a <quote>|</quote>, so this needs to match the expression on
 either side of that bar character also. A simple <quote>gif</quote> on one side, and the other
 side will in turn match either <quote>jpeg</quote> or <quote>jpg</quote>,
 since the <quote>?</quote> means the letter <quote>e</quote> is optional and
 can be matched once or not at all. So we are building an expression here to
 match image GIF or JPEG type image file. It must include the literal
 string <quote>advert</quote>, then one or more digits, and a <quote>.</quote>
 (which is now a literal, and not a special character, since it is escaped
 with <quote>\</quote>), and lastly either <quote>gif</quote>, or
 <quote>jpeg</quote>, or <quote>jpg</quote>. Some possible matches would
 include: <quote>//advert1.jpg</quote>,
 <quote>/nasty/ads/advert1234.gif</quote>,
 <quote>/banners/from/hell/advert99.jpg</quote>. It would not match
 <quote>advert1.gif</quote> (no leading slash), or
 <quote>/adverts232.jpg</quote> (the expression does not include an
 <quote>s</quote>), or <quote>/advert1.jsp</quote> (<quote>jsp</quote> is not
 in the expression anywhere).
</para>

<para>
 <emphasis><literal>s/microsoft(?!.com)/MicroSuck/i</literal></emphasis> - This is 
 a substitution. <quote>MicroSuck</quote> will replace any occurrence of 
 <quote>microsoft</quote>.  The <quote>i</quote> at the end of the expression
 means ignore case. The <quote>(?!.com)</quote> means 
 the match should fail if <quote>microsoft</quote> is followed by
 <quote>.com</quote>. In other words, this acts like a <quote>NOT</quote>
 modifier. In case this is a hyperlink, we don't want to break it ;-).
</para>

<para>
 We are barely scratching the surface of regular expressions here so that you
 can understand the default <application>Privoxy</application>
 configuration files, and maybe use this knowledge to customize your own
 installation. There is much, much more that can be done with regular
 expressions. Now that you know enough to get started, you can learn more on
 your own :/

<title><application>Privoxy</application>'s Internal Pages</title>

<para>
 Since <application>Privoxy</application> proxies each requested 
 web page, it is easy for <application>Privoxy</application> to 
 trap certain URLs. In this way, we can talk directly to
 <application>Privoxy</application>, and see how it is 
 configured, see how our rules are being applied, change these 
 rules and other configuration options, and even turn
 <application>Privoxy's</application> filtering off, all with 
 a web browser.

</para>

<para>
 The URLs listed below are the special ones that allow direct access 
 to <application>Privoxy</application>. Of course,
 <application>Privoxy</application> must be running to access these. If 
 not, you will get a friendly error message. Internet access is not 
 necessary either.

<sect2 id="actionsanat">
<title>Anatomy of an Action</title>

<para>
 The way <application>Privoxy</application> applies <quote>actions</quote>
 to any given URL can be complex, and not always so easy to understand what 
 is happening. And sometimes we need to be able to <emphasis>see</emphasis>
 just what <application>Privoxy</application> is doing. Especially, 
 if something <application>Privoxy</application> is doing is causing 
 us a problem inadvertantly. It can be a little daunting to look at 
 the actions files themselves, since they tend to be filled with 
 <quote>regular expressions</quote> whose consequences are not always 
 so obvious. <application>Privoxy</application> provides the 
 <ulink url="http://ijbswa.sourceforge.net/config/show-url-info">http://ijbswa.sourceforge.net/config/show-url-info</ulink>
 page that can show us very specifically how <application>actions</application>
 are being applied to any given URL. This is a big help for troubleshooting.
 </para>

<para>
 First, enter one URL (or partial URL) at the prompt, and then
 <application>Privoxy</application> will tell us 
 how current configuration will handle it. This will not
 help with filtering effects from the <filename>default.filter</filename>! It
 also will not tell you about any other URLs that may be embedded within the
 URL you are testing. For instance, images such as ads are expressed as URLs
 within the raw page source of HTML pages. So you will only get info for the
 actual URL that is pasted into the prompt area -- not any sub-URLs. If you
 want to know about embedded URLs like ads, you will have to dig those out of
 the HTML source. Use your browser's <quote>View Page Source</quote> option
 for this.
</para>

<para>
 Let's look at an example, <ulink url="http://google.com">google.com</ulink>, 
 one section at a time:
</para>

<para>
 <screen>
 System default actions:

 { -add-header -block -deanimate-gifs -downgrade -fast-redirects -filter 
   -hide-forwarded -hide-from -hide-referer -hide-user-agent -image 
   -image-blocker -limit-connect -no-compression -no-cookies-keep 
   -no-cookies-read -no-cookies-set -no-popups -vanilla-wafer -wafer }
 
 </screen>
</para>

<para>
 This is the top section, and only tells us of the compiled in defaults. This 
 is basically what <application>Privoxy</application> would do if there 
 were not any <quote>actions</quote> defined, i.e. it does nothing. Every action 
 is disabled. This is not particularly informative for our purposes here. OK,
 next section:
</para>

<para>
 <screen>

 Matches for http://google.com:

 { -add-header -block +deanimate-gifs -downgrade +fast-redirects 
   +filter{html-annoyances} +filter{js-annoyances} +filter{no-popups} 
   +filter{webbugs} +filter{nimda} +filter{banners-by-size} +filter{hal} 
   +filter{fun} +hide-forwarded +hide-from{block} +hide-referer{forge} 
   -hide-user-agent -image +image-blocker{blank} +no-compression 
   +no-cookies-keep -no-cookies-read -no-cookies-set +no-popups 
   -vanilla-wafer -wafer }
   /

 { -no-cookies-keep -no-cookies-read -no-cookies-set }
  .google.com

 { -fast-redirects }
  .google.com

 </screen>
</para>

<para>
 This is much more informative, and tells us how we have defined our 
 <quote>actions</quote>, and which ones match for our example, 
 <quote>google.com</quote>. The first grouping shows our default 
 settings, which would apply to all URLs. If you look at your <quote>actions</quote>
 file, this would be the section just below the <quote>aliases</quote> section 
 near the top. This applies to all URLs as signified by the single forward
 slash -- <quote>/</quote>.
 
</para>

<para>
 These are the default actions we have enabled. But we can define additional
 actions that would be exceptions to these general rules, and then list 
 specific URLs that these exceptions would apply to. Last match wins.
 Just below this then are two explict matches for <quote>.google.com</quote>.
 The first is negating our various cookie blocking actions (i.e. we will allow
 cookies here). The second is allowing <quote>fast-redirects</quote>. Note
 that there is a leading dot here -- <quote>.google.com</quote>. This will
 match any hosts and sub-domains, in the google.com domain also, such as
 <quote>www.google.com</quote>. So, apparently, we have these actions defined
 somewhere in the lower part of our actions file, and
 <quote>google.com</quote> is referenced in these sections.

</para>

<para>
 And now we pull it altogether in the bottom section and summarize how
 <application>Privoxy</application> is appying all its <quote>actions</quote> 
 to <quote>google.com</quote>:

</para>

<para>
 <screen>

 Final results:

 -add-header -block -deanimate-gifs -downgrade -fast-redirects 
 +filter{html-annoyances} +filter{js-annoyances} +filter{no-popups} 
 +filter{webbugs} +filter{nimda} +filter{banners-by-size} +filter{hal} 
 +filter{fun} +hide-forwarded +hide-from{block} +hide-referer{forge} 
 -hide-user-agent -image +image-blocker{blank} -limit-connect +no-compression 
 -no-cookies-keep -no-cookies-read -no-cookies-set +no-popups -vanilla-wafer 
 -wafer

 </screen>
</para>

<para>
 Now another example, <quote>ad.doubleclick.net</quote>:
</para>

<para>
 <screen>

 { +block +image }
  .ad.doubleclick.net

 { +block +image }
  ad*.

 { +block +image }
  .doubleclick.net

 </screen>
</para>

<para>
 We'll just show the interesting part here, the explicit matches. It is 
 matched three different times. Each as an <quote>+block +image</quote>,
 which is the expanded form of one of our aliases that had been defined as: 
 <quote>+imageblock</quote>. (<quote>Aliases</quote> are defined in the 
 first section of the actions file and typically used to combine more 
 than one action.)
</para>

<para>
 Any one of these would have done the trick and blocked this as an unwanted 
 image. This is unnecessarily redundant since the last case effectively 
 would also cover the first. No point in taking chances with these guys 
 though ;-) Note that if you want an ad or obnoxious 
 URL to be invisible, it should be defined as <quote>ad.doubleclick.net</quote>
 is done here -- as both a <quote>+block</quote> <emphasis>and</emphasis> an
 <quote>+image</quote>. The custom alias <quote>+imageblock</quote> does this
 for us.
</para>

<para>
 One last example. Let's try <quote>http://www.rhapsodyk.net/adsl/HOWTO/</quote>.
 This one is giving us problems. We are getting a blank page. Hmmm...
</para>

<para>
 <screen>

 Matches for http://www.rhapsodyk.net/adsl/HOWTO/:

 { -add-header -block +deanimate-gifs -downgrade +fast-redirects 
   +filter{html-annoyances} +filter{js-annoyances} +filter{no-popups} 
   +filter{webbugs} +filter{nimda} +filter{banners-by-size} +filter{hal} 
   +filter{fun} +hide-forwarded +hide-from{block} +hide-referer{forge} 
   -hide-user-agent -image +image-blocker{blank} +no-compression 
   +no-cookies-keep -no-cookies-read -no-cookies-set +no-popups 
   -vanilla-wafer -wafer }
   /

 { +block +image }
  /ads

 </screen>
</para>

<para>
 Ooops, the <quote>/adsl/</quote> is matching <quote>/ads</quote>! But 
 we did not want this at all! Now we see why we get the blank page. We could
 now add a new action below this that explictly does <emphasis>not</emphasis>
 block (-block) pages with <quote>adsl</quote>. There are various ways to
 handle such exceptions. Example:
</para>

<para>
 <screen>

 { -block }
  /adsl
 
 </screen>
</para>

<para>
 Now the page displays ;-)

</para>
