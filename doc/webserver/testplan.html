<h1>Testplan for releases:</h1>
<p>
<ol>
  <li>Remove any existing rpm with rpm -e
  <li>Remove any file that was left over. This includes (but is not limited
      to)
      <ul>
	<li>/var/log/junkbuster
	<li>/etc/junkbuster
	<li>/usr/sbin/junkbuster
	<li>/etc/init.d/junkbuster
	<li>/usr/doc/junkbuster*
      </ul>
  <li>Install the rpm. Any error messages?
  <li>start,stop,status junkbuster with the specific script
      (e.g. /etc/rc.d/init/junkbuster stop). Reboot your machine. Does
      autostart work?
  <li>Start browsing. Does the junkbuster work? Logfile written?
  <li>Remove the rpm. Any error messages? All files removed?
</ol>

<h1>Test reports:</h1>
<p>
Please submit test reports only with the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=add&group_id=11118&atid=395005">test form</a>
at sourceforge. Three simple steps:
<ul>
  <li>Select category: the distribution you test on.
  <li>Select group: the version of Junkbuster that we are about to release.
  <li>Fill the Summary and Detailed Description with something intelligent
      (keep it short and precise).
</ul>
<p>
Do not mail to the mailinglist (we cannot keep track on issues there).

 $Log: Makefile.in,v $

 fixes, because a clean build on rh6.1 was impossible.
 GZIP confuses make, %configure confuses rpm, etc.
