1. Frequently Asked Questions

1.1. General Information

1.1.1. What is this new version of Junkbuster?

   The original Internet Junkbuster (tm) is a coyrighted product of
   [52]Junkbusters Corporation. Development of this effort stopped some
   time ago as of version 2.0.2. Stefan Walherr started the ijbswa
   project on [53]Sourceforge to rekindle development. Other developers
   subsequently joined with Stefan, and have since added many new
   features, refinements and enhancements.
   
   The new Junkbuster started with the same code base, but has changed
   significantly at this point.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
1.1.2. How does it differ from the old Junkbuster?

   All the old features remain. The new Junkbuster still blocks ads and
   banners, still manages cookies, and still helps protect your privacy.
   But, these are all enhanced, and many new features have been added,
   all in the same vein.
   
   The configuration has changed significantly as well. This is something
   that users will notice right off the bat. The "blocklist" file does
   not exist any more. This is replaced by "actions" files, such as
   ijb.actions. This is where most of the per site configuration is now.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
1.1.3. What are some of the new features?

     * Integrated browser based configuration and control utility
       ([54]http://i.j.b). Browser-based tracing of rule and filter
       effects.
     * Blocking of annoying pop-up browser windows.
     * HTTP/1.1 compliant (most, but not all 1.1 features are supported).
     * Support for Perl Compatible Regular Expressions in the
       configuration files, and generally a more sophisticated and
       flexible configuration syntax over previous versions.
     * GIF de-animation.
     * Web page content filtering (removes banners based on size,
       invisible "web-bugs", JavaScript, pop-ups, status bar abuse, etc.)
     * Bypass many click-tracking scripts (avoids script redirection).
     * Multi-threaded (POSIX and native threads).
     * Auto-detection and re-reading of config file changes.
     * User-customizable HTML templates (e.g. 404 error page).
     * Improved cookie management features (e.g. session based cookies).
     * Builds from source on most UNIX-like systems. Packages available
       for: Linux (RedHat, SuSE, or Debian), Windows, Sun Solaris, Mac
       OSX, OS/2, HP-UX 11 and AmigaOS.
     * In addition, the configuration is much more powerful and versatile
       over-all.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
1.1.4. What is a "proxy"? How does Junkbuster work?

   When you connect to a web site with Junkbuster, you are really
   connecting to your locally running version of Junkbuster. Junkbuster
   intercepts your requests for the web page, and relays that to the
   "real" web site. The web site sends the HTTP data stream back to
   Junkbuster, where Junkbuster can work its magic before it relays this
   data back to your web browser.
   
   Since Junkbuster sits between you and the WWW, it is in a position to
   intercept and completely manage all web traffic and HTTP content
   before it gets to your browser. Junkbuster uses various programming
   methods to do this, all of which is under your control via the various
   configuration files and options.
   
   There are many kinds of proxies. Junkbuster best fits the "filtering
   proxy" category.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
1.1.5. My browser does the same things as Junkbuster. Why should I use
Junkbuster at all?

   Modern browsers do indeed have some of the same functionality as
   Junkbuster. Maybe this is adequate for you. But Junkbuster is much
   more verstatile and powerful, and can do a number of things that
   browsers just can't.
   
   In addition, a proxy is good choice if you use multiple browsers, or
   have a LAN with multiple computers. This way all the configuration is
   in one place, and you don't have to maintain a similar configuration
   for possibly many browsers.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
1.1.6. Is there is a license or fee? What about a warranty? Registration?

   Junkbuster is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL). It
   is free to use, copy, modify or distribute as you wish under the terms
   of this license. See [55]http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html for
   specifics.
   
   There is no warranty of any kind, expressed, implied or otherwise.
   That is something that would cost real money ;-) There is no
   registration either. Junkbuster really is free in every respect!
     _________________________________________________________________
   
1.2. Installation

1.2.1. Can I install the new Junkbuster over the old one?

   We recommend you uninstall the old Junkbuster first to minimize
   conflicts and confusion. You may want to save your old configuration
   files for future reference. The configuration is substantially
   changed.
   
   See the [56]user-manual for platform specific installation
   instructions. [FIXME: This is meant for after the name change for
   3.0!]
     _________________________________________________________________
   
1.2.2. I just installed Junkbuster. Is there anything special I have to do
now?

   All browsers must be told to use Junkbuster as a proxy by specifying
   the correct proxy address and port number in the appropriate
   configuration area for the browser. See below.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
1.2.3. What is the proxy address of Junkbuster?

   If you set up the Junkbuster to run on the computer you browse from
   (rather than your ISP's server or some networked computer on a LAN),
   the proxy will be on "localhost" (which is the special name used by
   every computer on the Internet to refer to itself) and the port will
   be 8118 (unless you have told the Internet Junkbuster to run on a
   different port with the listen-address config option).
   
   When configuring your browser's proxy settings you typically enter the
   word "localhost" in the boxes next to "HTTP" and "Secure" (HTTPS) and
   then the number "8118" for "port". This tells your browser to send all
   web requests to "Junkbuster" instead of directly to the Interenet.
   
   Junkbuster can also be used to proxy for a Local Area Network. In this
   case, your would enter either the IP address of the LAN host where
   Junkbuster is running, or the equivalent hostname. Port assignment
   would be same as above.
   
   Junkbuster does not currently handle protocols such as FTP, SMTP, IM,
   IRC, ICQ, or other Internet protocols.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
1.2.4. I just installed Junkbuster, and nothing is happening. All the ads
are there. What's wrong?

   Did you configure your browser to use Junkbuster as a proxy? It does
   not sound like it. See above. You might also try flushing the
   browser's caches to force a full re-reading of pages. You can verify
   that Junkbuster is running, and your browser is correctly configured
   by entering the special URL: [57]http://i.j.b/. This should give you a
   banner that says "This is the Internet JUNKBUSTER" and access to
   Junkbuster's internal configuration. If you see this, then you are
   good to go. If not, the browser or Junkbuster are not set up
   correctly.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
1.3. Configuration

1.3.1. Can I use my old config files?

   There are major changes to Junkbuster configuration from version 2.0.x
   to 2.9.x and later. The older files will not work at all. If this is
   the case, you will need to re-enter your old data into the new
   configuration structure. This is probably also a good recommendation
   even if upgrading from 2.9.x to 3.x since there were many minor
   changes along the way.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
1.3.2. What is an "actions" file?

   "actions" files are where various actions that Junkbuster might take,
   are configured. Typically, you would define a set of default actions
   that apply to all URLs, then add exceptions to these defaults.
   
   Actions can be defined on a per site basis, or for groups of sites.
   Actions can also be grouped together and then applied to one or more
   sites. There are many possible actions that might apply to any given
   site. As an example, if we are blocking cookies as one of our default
   actions, but need to accept cookies from a given site, we would define
   this in our "actions" file.
   
   Junkbuster comes with several default actions files, with varying
   degrees of filtering and blocking, as starting points for your own
   configuration (see below).
     _________________________________________________________________
   
1.3.3. The "actions"concept confuses me. Please list some of these
"actions".

   These are all explained in the [58]user-manual. Please refer to that.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
1.3.4. How are actions files configured? What is the easiest way to do this?

   The easiest way to do this, is to access Junkbuster with your web
   browser at [59]http://i.j.b/, and then select "[60]Edit the actions
   list" from the selection list. You can also do this by editing the
   appropriate file with a text editor.
   
   Please see the [61]user-manual for a detailed explanation of these and
   other configuration files, and their various options and syntax.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
1.3.5. What are the differences between ijb-intermediate.action,
ijb-basic.action, etc.?

   Configuring the Internet Junkbuster is not easy. To help you get
   started, we provide you with three different default configurations.
   The following table shows you, which features are enabled in each
   configuration.
   
   Table 1. Default Configurations
   Feature ijb.action ijb-basic.action ijb-intermediate.action
   ijb-advanced.action
   ad-filtering ? x x x
   blank image ? x x x
   de-animate GIFs ? x x x
   referer forging ? x x x
   jon's +no-cookies-keep (i.e. session cookies only) ? x x x
   no-popup windows ?   x x
   fast redirects ?   x x
   hide-referrer ?   x x
   hide-useragent ?   x x
   content-modification ?     x
   feature-x ?
   feature-y ?
   feature-z ?
     _________________________________________________________________
   
1.3.6. Why can I change the configuration with a browser? Does that not
raise security issues?

   What I don't understand, is how I can browser edit the config file as
   a regular user, while the whole /etc/junkbuster hierarchy belongs to
   the user "junkbuster", with only 644 perms.
   
   When you use the browser-based editor, JunkBuster itself is writing to
   the config files. Because JunkBuster is running as the user
   "junkbuster", it can update the config files.
   
   If you don't like this, setting "enable-edit-actions 0" in the config
   file will disable the browser-based editor. If you're that paranoid,
   you should also consider setting "enable-remote-toggle 0" to prevent
   browser-based enabling/disabling of JunkBuster.
   
   Note that normally only local users can connect to JunkBuster, so this
   is not (normally) a security problem.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
1.3.7. How can I set up Junkbuster to act as a proxy for my LAN?

   By default, Junkbuster only responds to requests from localhost. To
   have it act as a server for a network, this needs to be changed in the
   main config file where the Junkbuster configuration is located. In
   that file is a "listen-address" option. It may be commented out with a
   "#" symbol. Make sure it is uncommented, and assign it the address of
   the LAN gateway interface, and port number to use:
   
  listen-address  192.168.1.1:8118

   Save the file, and restart Junkbuster. Configure all browsers on the
   network then to use this address and port number.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
1.3.8. Instead of ads, now I get a Junkbuster logo [or checkerboard]. I
don't want to see anything.

   This is a configuration option for images that Junkbuster is stopping.
   You have the choice of the Junkbuster logo, a checkerboard pattern
   (this scales better), a transparent 1x1 GIF image, or a custom URL or
   your choice.
   
   If you want to see nothing, then change the "+image-blocker" action to
   "+image-blocker{blank}". This can be done from the "Edit Actions List"
   selection at [62]http://i.j.b/. Or by hand editing the appropriate
   actions file. This will only effect what is defined as "images"
   though.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
1.3.9. Why would anybody want to see the logo or checkerboard?

   This can be helpful for troubleshooting problems. It might also be
   good for anyone new to Junkbuster so that they can see if their
   favorite pages are displaying correctly, and Junkbuster is not
   inadvertantly removing something important.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
1.3.10. I see large red banners on some pages that say "Blocked". How do I
get rid of this?

   These are URLs that match something in one of Junkbuster's block
   actions (+block). It is meant to be a warning so that you know
   something has been blocked and an easy way for you to see why. These
   are handled differently than what has been defined as "images" (e.g.
   ad banners). If you want them to be treated as if they were images, so
   that they can be invisible, then move the offending URL from the
   "+block" section to the "+imageblock" section of your actions file.
   Alternately, you could modify the "block" HTML template that is used
   by Junkbuster to display this, and make it something more to your
   liking.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
1.4. Misc

1.4.1. How much does Junkbuster slow my browsing down? This has to add extra
time to browsing.

   It should not slow you down any in real terms, and may actually help
   speed things up since ads, banners and other junk are not being
   displayed. The actual processing time required by Junkbuster itself
   for each page, is relatively small in the overall scheme of things,
   and happens very quickly. This is typically more than offset by time
   saved not downloading and rendering ad images.
   
   "Filtering" via the re_filterfile mechanism may cause a perceived
   slowdown, since the entire page is buffered before displaying. See
   below.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
1.4.2. I noticed considerable delays in page requests compared to the old
IJB. What's wrong?

   Using the default filtering configuration, I noticed considerable
   delays in page requests compared to the old IJB. Loading pages with
   large contents seemed to take forever, then suddenly delivering all
   the content at once.
   
   The whole content must be loaded in order to filter, and nothing is is
   sent to the browser during this time. The loading time does not really
   change in real numbers, but the feeling is different, because most
   browsers are able to start rendering incomplete content, giving the
   user a feeling of "it works".
   
   To modify the content of a page (i.e. make frames resizeable again,
   etc.) and not just replace ads, the Internet Junkbuster needs to
   download the entire page first, do its content magic and then send the
   page to the browser.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
1.4.3. What is the "http://i.j.b/"?

   Since JunkBuster sits between your web browser and the Internet, it
   can be programmed to handle certain pages specially.
   
   With recent versions of JunkBuster (version 2.9.x), you can get some
   information about JunkBuster and change some settings by going to
   http://i.j.b/ or, equivalently, http://ijbswa.sourceforge.net/config/
   (Note that i.j.b is far easier to type but may not work in some
   configurations).
   
   These pages are *not* forwarded to a server on the internet - instead
   they are handled by a special web server which is built in to
   JunkBuster.
   
   If you are not running JunkBuster, then http://i.j.b/ will fail, and
   http://ijbswa.sourceforge.net/config/ will return a web page telling
   you you're not running JunkBuster.
   
   If you have version 2.0.2, then the equivalent is
   http://example.com/show-proxy-args (but you get far less information,
   and you should really consider upgrading to 2.9.x).
     _________________________________________________________________
   
1.4.4. I would like to help you, what do I do?

   Well, helping the team is always a good idea. We welcome new
   developers, RPM gurus or documentation makers. Simply get an account
   on sourceforge.net and mail your id to the developer mailing list.
   Once we have added you to the team, you'll have write access to the
   CVS repository, and together we'll find a suitable task for you.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
1.4.5. Do you still maintain the blocklists?

   No. The format of the blocklists has changed significantly in the
   versions 2.9.x. Once we have released the new version, there will
   again be blocklists that you can update automatically.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
1.4.6. How can I submit new ads?

   As of now, please discontinue to submit new ad blocking infos. Once we
   have released the new version, there will again be a form on the
   website, which you can use to contribute new ads.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
1.4.7. How can I hide my IP address?

   You cannot hide your IP address with Junkbuster or any other software,
   since the server needs to know your IP address to send the answer to
   you.
   
   Fortunately there are many publicly usable anonymous proxies out
   there, which solve the problem by providing a further level of
   indirection between you and the web server, shared by many people and
   thus letting your requests "drown" in white noise of unrelated
   requests as far as user tracking is concerned.
   
   Most of them will, however, log your IP address and make it available
   to the authorities in case you abuse that anonymity for criminal
   purposes. In fact you can't even rule out that some of them only exist
   to *collect* information on (those suspicious) people with a more than
   average preference for privacy.
   
   You can find a list of anonymous public proxies at [63]multiproxy.org
   and many more through Google.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
1.4.8. Can Junkbuster guarantee I am anonymous?

   No. Your chances of remaining anonymous are greatly improved, but
   unless you are an expert on Internet security it would be safest to
   assume that everything you do on the Web can be traced back to you.
   
   Junkbuster can remove various information about you, and allows you
   more freedom to decide which sites you can trust. But it's still
   possible that web sites can find out who you are. Here's one way this
   can happen.
   
   A few browsers disclose the user's email address in certain
   situations, such as when transferring a file by FTP. Junkbuster does
   not filter FTP. If you need this feature, or are concerned about the
   mail handler of your browser disclosing your email address, you might
   consider products such as NSClean.
   
   Browsers available only as binaries could use non-standard headers to
   give out any information they can have access to: see the
   manufacturer's license agreement. It's impossible to anticipate and
   prevent every breach of privacy that might occur. The professionally
   paranoid prefer browsers available as source code, because
   anticipating their behavior is easier. Trust the source, Luke!
     _________________________________________________________________
   
1.4.9. Might some things break because header information is being altered?

   Definitely. More and more sites use HTTP header content to decide what
   to display and how to display it. There is many ways that this can be
   handled, so having hard and fast rules, is tricky.
   
   "USER AGENT" in particular is often used in this way to identify the
   browser, and adjust content accordingly. Changing this now is not
   recommended, since so many sites do look for this. You may get
   undesirable results by changing this.
   
   For instance, different browsers use different encodings of Russian
   and Czech characters, certain web servers convert pages on-the-fly
   according to the User Agent header. Giving a "User Agent" with the
   wrong operating system or browser manufacturer causes some sites in
   these languages to be garbled; Surfers to Eastern European sites
   should change it to something closer. And then some page access
   counters work by looking at the "REFERER" header; they may fail or
   break if unavailable. The weather maps of Intellicast have been
   blocked by their server when no "REFERER" or cookie is provided, is
   another example. There are many, many other ways things can go wrong
   when trying to fool a web server.
   
   If you have problems with a site, you will have to adjust your
   configuration accordingly. Cookies are probably the most likely
   adjustment that may be required, but by no means the only one.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
1.4.10. Can Junkbuster act as a "caching" proxy to speed up web browsing?

   No, it does not have this ability at all. You want something like
   [64]Squid for this. And, yes, before you ask, Junkbuster can co-exist
   with other kinds of proxies like "Squid".
     _________________________________________________________________
   
1.4.11. What about as a firewall? Can Junkbuster protect me?

   Not in the way you mean, or in the way a true firewall can, or a proxy
   that has this specific capability. Junkbuster can help protect your
   privacy, but not really protect you from intrusion attempts.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
1.4.12. The Junkbuster logo that replaces ads is very blocky and ugly
looking. Can't a better font be used?

   This is not a font problem. The logo is an image that is created by
   Junkbuster on the fly. So as to not waste memory, the image is rather
   small. The blockiness comes when the image is scaled to fill a largish
   area. There is not much to be done about this, other than to use one
   of the other "imageblock" directives: pattern, blank, or a URL of your
   chosing.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
1.4.13. I have large empty spaces now where ads used to be. Why does
Junkbuster leave these large gaps?

   It would be easy enough to just eliminate this space altogether,
   rather than fill it with blank space. But, this would create problems
   with many pages that use the overall size of the ad to help organize
   the page layout and position the various components of the page where
   they were intended to be. It is best left this way.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
1.4.14. How can Junkbuster filter Secure (HTTPS) URLs?

   This is a limitation since HTTPS transactions are encrypted SSL
   sessions between your browser and the secure site, and are meant to be
   reliably secure and private. This means that all cookies and HTTP
   header information are also encrypted from the time they leave your
   browser, to the site, and vice versa. Junkbuster does not try to
   unencrypt this information, so it just passes through as is.
   Junkbuster can still catch images and ads that are embedded in the SSL
   stream though.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
1.4.15. Junkbuster runs as a "server". How secure is it? Do I need to take
any special precautions?

   There are no known exploits that might effect Junkbuster. On Unix-like
   systems, Junkbuster can run as a non-privileged user, which is how we
   recommend it be run. Also, by default Junkbuster only listens to
   requests from "localhost". It is not itself directly exposed to the
   Internet in this configuration. If you want to have Junkbuster serve
   as a LAN proxy, this will have to be opened up to allow for LAN
   requests. In this case, we'd recommend you specify only the LAN
   gateway address, e.g. 192.168.1.1 in the main Junkbuster config file.
   All LAN hosts can then use this as their proxy address in the browser
   proxy configuration. In this way, Junkbuster will not listen on any
   external ports. Of course, a firewall is always good too. Better safe
   than sorry.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
1.4.16. What is a "re_filterfile"?

   The "re_filterfile" is used to "filter" any page content. By
   "filtering" we mean it can modify, remove, or change anything on the
   page, including HTML tags, and JavaScript. Regular expressions are
   used to accomplish this. This is potentially a very powerful feature,
   but requires some expertise.
   
   If you are familiar with regular expressions, and HTML, you can look
   at the provided re_filterfile with a text editor and see some of
   things it can be used for.
   
   Presently, there is no GUI editor option for this part of the
   configuration.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
1.5. Troubleshooting

1.5.1. I just upgraded and am getting "connection refused" with every web
page?

   Either Junkbuster is not running, or your browser is configured for a
   different port than what Junkbuster is using.
   
   The old Junkbuster used port 8000 by default. This has been changed to
   port 8118 now, due to a conflict with NAS (Network Audio Service),
   which uses port 8000. If you haven't, you need to change your browser
   to the new port number, or alternately change Junkbuster's
   "listen-address" setting in the config file used to start Junkbuster.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
1.5.2. I just added a new rule, but the steenkin ad is still getting
through. How?

   If the ad had been displayed before you added its URL, it will
   probably be held in the browser's cache for some time, so it will be
   displayed without the need for any request to the server, and
   Junkbuster will not be in the picture. The best thing to do is try
   flusing the browser's caches. And then try again.
   
   If this doesn't help, you probably have an error in the rule you
   applied. Try pasting the full URL of the offending ad into
   [65]http://ijbswa.sourceforge.net/config/show-url-info and see if any
   actions match your new rule.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
1.5.3. One of my favorite sites does not work with Junkbuster. What can I
do?

   First verify that it is indeed a Junkbuster problem, by disabling
   Junkbuster filtering and blocking. Go to [66]http://i.j.b/ and click
   on "Toggle Junkbuster On or Off", then disable it. Now try that page
   again.
   
   If still a problem, go to "Show which actions apply to a URL and why"
   from [67]http://i.j.b/ and paste the full URL of the page in question
   into the prompt. See which actions are being applied to the URL. Now,
   armed with this information, go to "Edit the actions list". Here you
   should see various sections that have various "Junkbuster" features
   disabled for specific sites. Disabled "actions" will have a "-" (minus
   sign) in front of them. Add your problem page URL to one of these
   sections that looks like it is disabling the feature that is causing
   the problem. Re-try the page. There might be some trial and error
   involved. This is discussed in a little more detail in the
   [68]user-manual appendix.
   
   Alternately, if you are comfortable with a text editor, you can
   accomplish the same thing by editing the appropriate "actions" file.
