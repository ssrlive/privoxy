   The FAQ document gives users and developers alike answers to
   frequently asked questions about the Internet Junkbuster. Internet
   Junkbuster is a web proxy with advanced filtering capabilities for
   protecting privacy, filtering web page content, managing cookies,
   controlling access, and removing ads, banners, pop-ups and other
   obnoxious Internet Junk. Junkbuster has a very flexible configuration
   and can be customized to suit individual needs and tastes. Internet
   Junkbuster has application for both stand-alone systems and multi-user
   networks.

2.2.4. What are the differences between ijb-intermediate.action,
ijb-basic.action, etc.?

   Configuring the Internet Junkbuster is not easy. To help you get
   started, we provide you with three different default configurations.
   The following table shows you, which features are enabled in each
   configuration.

2.2.5. Why can I change the configuration with a browser? Does that not
raise security issues?

   What I don't understand, is how I can browser edit the config file as
   a regular user, while the whole /etc/junkbuster hierarchy belongs to
   the user "junkbuster", with only 644 perms.
   
   When you use the browser-based editor, JunkBuster itself is writing to
   the config files. Because JunkBuster is running as the user
   "junkbuster", it can update the config files.
   
   If you don't like this, setting "enable-edit-actions 0" in the config
   file will disable the browser-based editor. If you're that paranoid,
   you should also consider setting "enable-remote-toggle 0" to prevent
   browser-based enabling/disabling of JunkBuster.
   
   Note that normally only local users can connect to JunkBuster, so this
   is not (normally) a security problem.

2.3. Misc

2.3.1. I noticed considerable delays in page requests compared to the old
IJB. What's wrong?

   Using the default filtering configuration, I noticed considerable
   delays in page requests compared to the old IJB. Loading pages with
   large contents seemed to take forever, then suddenly delivering all
   the content at once.
   
   The whole content must be loaded in order to filter, and nothing is is
   sent to the browser during this time. The loading time does not really
   change in real numbers, but the feeling is different, because most
   browsers are able to start rendering incomplete content, giving the
   user a feeling of "it works".
   
   To modify the content of a page (i.e. make frames resizeable again,
   etc.) and not just replace ads, the Internet Junkbuster needs to
   download the entire page first, do its content magic and then send the
   page to the browser.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
2.3.2. What is the "http://i.j.b/"?

   Since JunkBuster sits between your web browser and the Internet, it
   can be programmed to handle certain pages specially.
   
   With recent versions of JunkBuster (version 2.9.x), you can get some
   information about JunkBuster and change some settings by going to
   http://i.j.b/ or, equivalently, http://ijbswa.sourceforge.net/config/
   (Note that i.j.b is far easier to type but may not work in some
   configurations).
   
   These pages are *not* forwarded to a server on the internet - instead
   they are handled by a special web server which is built in to
   JunkBuster.
   
   If you are not running JunkBuster, then http://i.j.b/ will fail, and
   http://ijbswa.sourceforge.net/config/ will return a web page telling
   you you're not running JunkBuster.
   
   If you have version 2.0.2, then the equivalent is
   http://example.com/show-proxy-args (but you get far less information,
   and you should really consider upgrading to 2.9.x).

2.3.3. I get the message 'Bad File Descriptor', why?

2.3.4. How do I chain Junkbuster with other proxies (e.g. squid)?

   Fillme.

2.3.5. I would like to help you, what do I do?

   Well, helping the team is always a good idea. We welcome new
   developers, RPM gurus or documentation makers. Simply get an account
   on sourceforge.net and mail your id to the developer mailing list.
   Once we have added you to the team, you'll have write access to the
   CVS repository, and together we'll find a suitable task for you.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
2.3.6. Do you still maintain the blocklists?

   No. The format of the blocklists has changed significantly in the
   versions 2.9.x. Once we have released the new version, there will
   again be blocklists that you can update automatically.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
2.3.7. How can I submit new ads?

   As of now, please discontinue to submit new ad blocking infos. Once we
   have released the new version, there will again be a form on the
   website, which you can use to contribute new ads.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
2.3.8. How can I hide my IP address?

   You cannot hide your IP address with Junkbuster or any other software,
   since the server needs to know your IP address to send the answer to
   you.
   
   Fortunately there are many publicly usable anonymous proxies out
   there, which solve the problem by providing a further level of
   indirection between you and the web server, shared by many people and
   thus letting your requests "drown" in white noise of unrelated
   requests as far as user tracking is concerned.
   
   Most of them will, however, log your IP address and make it available
   to the authorities in case you abuse that anonymity for criminal
   purposes. In fact you can't even rule out that some of them only exist
   to *collect* information on (those suspicious) people with a more than
   average preference for privacy.
   
   You can find a list of anonymous public proxies at [24]multiproxy.org
   and many more through Google.
