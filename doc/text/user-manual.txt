1. Introduction

   Internet Junkbuster is a web proxy with advanced filtering
   capabilities for protecting privacy, filtering and modifying web page
   content, managing cookies, controlling access, and removing ads,
   banners, pop-ups and other obnoxious Internet Junk. Junkbuster has a
   very flexible configuration and can be customized to suit individual
   needs and tastes. Internet Junkbuster has application for both
   stand-alone systems and multi-user networks.
   
   This documentation is included with the current BETA version of
   Internet Junkbuster and is mostly complete at this point. The most up
   to date reference for the time being is still the comments in the
   source files and in the individual configuration files. Development of
   version 3.0 is currently nearing completion, and includes many
   significant changes and enhancements over earlier versions. The target
   release date for stable v3.0 is "soon" ;-)
   
   Since this is a BETA version, not all new features are well tested.
   This documentation may be slightly out of sync as a result (especially
   with CVS sources). And there may be bugs, though hopefully not many!
     _________________________________________________________________
   
1.1. New Features

   In addition to Junkbuster's traditional features of ad and banner
   blocking and cookie management, this is a list of new features
   currently under development:
   
     * Integrated browser based configuration and control utility
       ([36]http://i.j.b). Browser-based tracing of rule and filter
       effects.
     * Modularized configuration that will allow for system wide
       settings, and individual user settings. (not implemented yet,
       probably a 3.1 feature)
     * Blocking of annoying pop-up browser windows.
     * HTTP/1.1 compliant (most, but not all 1.1 features are supported).
     * Support for Perl Compatible Regular Expressions in the
       configuration files, and generally a more sophisticated and
       flexible configuration syntax over previous versions.
     * GIF de-animation.
     * Web page content filtering (removes banners based on size,
       invisible "web-bugs", JavaScript, pop-ups, status bar abuse, etc.)
     * Bypass many click-tracking scripts (avoids script redirection).
     * Multi-threaded (POSIX and native threads).
     * Auto-detection and re-reading of config file changes.
     * User-customizable HTML templates (e.g. 404 error page).
     * Improved cookie management features (e.g. session based cookies).
     * Builds from source on most UNIX-like systems. Packages available
       for: Linux (RedHat, SuSE, or Debian), Windows, Sun Solaris, Mac
       OSX, OS/2, HP-UX 11 and AmigaOS.
     * In addition, the configuration is much more powerful and versatile
       over-all.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
2. Installation

   Junkbuster is available as raw source code, or pre-compiled binaries.
   See the [37]Junkbuster Home Page for binaries and current release
   info. Junkbuster is also available via [38]CVS. This is the
   recommended approach at this time. But please be aware that CVS is
   constantly changing, and it may break in mysterious ways.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
2.1. Source

   For gzipped tar archives, unpack the source:
   
 tar xzvf ijb_source_* [.tgz or .tar.gz]
 cd ijb_source_2.9.11_beta

   For retrieving the current CVS sources, you'll need the CVS package
   installed first. To download CVS source:
   
  cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.ijbswa.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/ijbswa login
  cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.ijbswa.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/ijbswa co cu
rrent
  cd current

   This will create a directory named current/, which will contain the
   source tree.
   
   Then, in either case, to build from tarball/CVS source:
   
 ./configure      (--help to see options)
 make             (the make from gnu, gmake for *BSD)
 su
 make -n install  (to see where all the files will go)
 make install     (to really install)

   For Redhat and SuSE Linux RPM packages, see below.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
2.2. Red Hat

   To build Redhat RPM packages, install source as above. Then:
   
 autoheader   [suggested for CVS source]
 autoconf     [suggested for CVS source]
 ./configure
 make redhat-dist

   This will create both binary and src RPMs in the usual places.
   Example:
   
      /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i686/junkbuster-2.9.11-1.i686.rpm
   
      /usr/src/redhat/SRPMS/junkbuster-2.9.11-1.src.rpm
   
   To install, of course:
   
 rpm -Uvv /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i686/junkbuster-2.9.11-1.i686.rpm

   This will place the Junkbuster configuration files in
   /etc/junkbuster/, and log files in /var/log/junkbuster/.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
2.3. SuSE

   To build SuSE RPM packages, install source as above. Then:
   
 autoheader   [suggested for CVS source]
 autoconf     [suggested for CVS source]
 ./configure
 make suse-dist

   This will create both binary and src RPMs in the usual places.
   Example:
   
      /usr/src/packages/RPMS/i686/junkbuster-2.9.11-1.i686.rpm
   
      /usr/src/packages/SRPMS/junkbuster-2.9.11-1.src.rpm
   
   To install, of course:
   
 rpm -Uvv /usr/src/packages/RPMS/i686/junkbuster-2.9.11-1.i686.rpm

   This will place the Junkbuster configuration files in
   /etc/junkbuster/, and log files in /var/log/junkbuster/.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
2.4. OS/2

   Junkbuster is packaged in a WarpIN self- installing archive. The
   self-installing program will be named depending on the release
   version, something like: ijbos2_setup_1.2.3.exe. In order to install
   it, simply run this executable or double-click on its icon and follow
   the WarpIN installation panels. A shadow of the Junkbuster executable
   will be placed in your startup folder so it will start automatically
   whenever OS/2 starts.
   
   The directory you choose to install Junkbuster into will contain all
   of the configuration files.
   
   If you would like to build binary images on OS/2 yourself, you will
   need a few Unix-like tools: autoconf, autoheader and sh. These tools
   will be used to create the required config.h file, which is not part
   of the source distribution because it differs based on platform. You
   will also need a compiler. The distribution has been created using IBM
   VisualAge compilers, but you can use any compiler you like. GCC/EMX
   has the disadvantage of needing to be single-threaded due to a
   limitation of EMX's implementation of the select() socket call.
   
   In addition to needing the source code distribution as outlined
   earlier, you will want to extract the os2seutp directory from CVS:
 cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.ijbswa.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/ijbswa login

 cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.ijbswa.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/ijbswa co os2
setup

   This will create a directory named os2setup/, which will contain the
   Makefile.vac makefile and os2build.cmd which is used to completely
   create the binary distribution. The sequence of events for building
   the executable for yourself goes something like this:
 cd current
 autoheader
 autoconf
 sh configure
 cd ..\os2setup
 nmake -f Makefile.vac

   You will see this sequence laid out in os2build.cmd.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
2.5. Windows

   Click-click. (I need help on this. Not a clue here. Also for
   configuration section below. HB.)
     _________________________________________________________________
   
2.6. Other

   Some quick notes on other Operating Systems.
   
   For FreeBSD (and other *BSDs?), the build will require gmake instead
   of the included make. gmake is available from [39]http://www.gnu.org.
   The rest should be the same as above for Linux/Unix.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
3. JunkBuster Configuration

   All JunkBuster configuration is kept in text files. These files can be
   edited with a text editor. Many important aspects of JunkBuster can
   also be controlled easily with a web browser.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
3.1. Controlling Junkbuster with Your Web Browser

   JunkBuster can be reached by the special URL [40]http://i.j.b/ (or
   alternately [41]http://ijbswa.sourceforge.net/config/, which is an
   internal page. You will see the following section:
   
Please choose from the following options:

    * Show information about the current configuration
    * Show the source code version numbers
    * Show the client's request headers.
    * Show which actions apply to a URL and why
    * Toggle JunkBuster on or off
    * Edit the actions list


   This should be self-explanatory. Note the last item is an editor for
   the "actions list", which is where much of the ad, banner, cookie, and
   URL blocking magic is configured as well as other advanced features of
   Junkbuster. This is an easy way to adjust various aspects of
   Junkbuster configuration. The actions file, and other configuration
   files, are explained in detail below. Junkbuster will automatically
   detect any changes to these files.
   
   "Toggle JunkBuster On or Off" is handy for sites that might have
   problems with your current actions and filters, or just to test if a
   site misbehaves, whether it is JunkBuster causing the problem or not.
   Junkbuster continues to run as a proxy in this case, but all filtering
   is disabled.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
3.2. Configuration Files Overview

   For Unix, *BSD and Linux, all configuration files are located in
   /etc/junkbuster/ by default. For MS Windows, OS/2, and AmigaOS these
   are all in the same directory as the Junkbuster executable. The name
   and number of configuration files has changed from previous versions,
   and is subject to change as development progresses.
   
   The installed defaults provide a reasonable starting point, though
   possibly aggressive by some standards. For the time being, there are
   only three default configuration files (this will change in time):
   
     * The main configuration file is named config on Linux, Unix, BSD,
       OS/2, and AmigaOS and config.txt on Windows.
     * The ijb.action file is used to define various "actions" relating
       to images, banners, pop-ups, access restrictions, banners and
       cookies. There is a CGI based editor for this file that can be
       accessed via [42]http://i.j.b. (Other actions files are included
       as well with differing levels of filtering and blocking, e.g.
       ijb-basic.action.)
     * The re_filterfile file can be used to re-write the raw page
       content, including viewable text as well as embedded HTML and
       JavaScript, and whatever else lurks on any given web page.
       
   ijb.action and re_filterfile can use Perl style regular expressions
   for maximum flexibility. All files use the "#" character to denote a
   comment. Such lines are not processed by Junkbuster. After making any
   changes, there is no need to restart Junkbuster in order for the
   changes to take effect. Junkbuster should detect such changes
   automatically.
   
   While under development, the configuration content is subject to
   change. The below documentation may not be accurate by the time you
   read this. Also, what constitutes a "default" setting, may change, so
   please check all your configuration files on important issues.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
3.3. The Main Configuration File

   Again, the main configuration file is named config on Linux/Unix/BSD
   and OS/2, and config.txt on Windows. Configuration lines consist of an
   initial keyword followed by a list of values, all separated by
   whitespace (any number of spaces or tabs). For example:
   
     blockfile blocklist.ini
   
   Indicates that the blockfile is named "blocklist.ini".
   
   A "#" indicates a comment. Any part of a line following a "#" is
   ignored, except if the "#" is preceded by a "\".
   
   Thus, by placing a "#" at the start of an existing configuration line,
   you can make it a comment and it will be treated as if it weren't
   there. This is called "commenting out" an option and can be useful to
   turn off features: If you comment out the "logfile" line, junkbuster
   will not log to a file at all. Watch for the "default:" section in
   each explanation to see what happens if the option is left unset (or
   commented out).
   
   Long lines can be continued on the next line by using a "\" as the
   very last character.
   
   There are various aspects of Junkbuster behavior that can be tuned.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
3.3.1. Defining Other Configuration Files

   Junkbuster can use a number of other files to tell it what ads to
   block, what cookies to accept, etc. This section of the configuration
   file tells Junkbuster where to find all those other files.
   
   On Windows and AmigaOS, Junkbuster looks for these files in the same
   directory as the executable. On Unix and OS/2, Junkbuster looks for
   these files in the current working directory. In either case, an
   absolute path name can be used to avoid problems.
   
   When development goes modular and multi-user, the blocker, filter, and
   per-user config will be stored in subdirectories of "confdir". For
   now, only confdir/templates is used for storing HTML templates for CGI
   results.
   
   The location of the configuration files:
   
     confdir /etc/junkbuster       # No trailing /, please.
   
   The directory where all logging (i.e. logfile and jarfile) takes
   place. No trailing "/", please:
   
     logdir /var/log/junkbuster
   
   Note that all file specifications below are relative to the above two
   directories!
   
   The "ijb.action" file contains patterns to specify the actions to
   apply to requests for each site. Default: Cookies to and from all
   destinations are kept only during the current browser session (i.e.
   they are not saved to disk). Pop-ups are disabled for all sites. All
   sites are filtered through selected sections of "re_filterfile". No
   sites are blocked. The JunkBuster logo is displayed for filtered ads
   and other images . The syntax of this file is explained in detail
   [43]below.
   
     actionsfile ijb.action
   
   The "re_filterfile" file contains content modification rules that use
   "regular expressions". These rules permit powerful changes on the
   content of Web pages, e.g., you could disable your favorite JavaScript
   annoyances, re-write the actual displayed text, or just have some fun
   replacing "Microsoft" with "MicroSuck" wherever it appears on a Web
   page. Default: whatever the developers are playing with :-/
   
   Filtering requires buffering the page content, which may appear to
   slow down page rendering since nothing is displayed until all content
   has passed the filters. (It does not really take longer, but seems
   that way since the page is not incrementally displayed.) This effect
   will be more noticeable on slower connections.
   
     re_filterfile re_filterfile
   
   The logfile is where all logging and error messages are written. The
   logfile can be useful for tracking down a problem with Junkbuster
   (e.g., it's not blocking an ad you think it should block) but in most
   cases you probably will never look at it.
   
   Your logfile will grow indefinitely, and you will probably want to
   periodically remove it. On Unix systems, you can do this with a cron
   job (see "man cron"). For Redhat, a logrotate script has been
   included.
   
   On SuSE Linux systems, you can place a line like
   "/var/log/junkbuster.* +1024k 644 nobody.nogroup" in /etc/logfiles,
   with the effect that cron.daily will automatically archive, gzip, and
   empty the log, when it exceeds 1M size.
   
   Default: Log to the a file named logfile. Comment out to disable
   logging.
   
     logfile logfile
   
   The "jarfile" defines where Junkbuster stores the cookies it
   intercepts. Note that if you use a "jarfile", it may grow quite large.
   Default: Don't store intercepted cookies.
   
     #jarfile jarfile
   
   If you specify a "trustfile", Junkbuster will only allow access to
   sites that are named in the trustfile. You can also mark sites as
   trusted referrers, with the effect that access to untrusted sites will
   be granted, if a link from a trusted referrer was used. The link
   target will then be added to the "trustfile". This is a very
   restrictive feature that typical users most probably want to leave
   disabled. Default: Disabled, don't use the trust mechanism.
   
     #trustfile trust
   
   If you use the trust mechanism, it is a good idea to write up some
   on-line documentation about your blocking policy and to specify the
   URL(s) here. They will appear on the page that your users receive when
   they try to access untrusted content. Use multiple times for multiple
   URLs. Default: Don't display links on the "untrusted" info page.
   
     trust-info-url http://www.your-site.com/why_we_block.html
     trust-info-url http://www.your-site.com/what_we_allow.html
     _________________________________________________________________
   
3.3.2. Other Configuration Options

   This part of the configuration file contains options that control how
   Junkbuster operates.
   
   "Admin-address" should be set to the email address of the proxy
   administrator. It is used in many of the proxy-generated pages.
   Default: fill@me.in.please.
   
     #admin-address fill@me.in.please
   
   "Proxy-info-url" can be set to a URL that contains more info about
   this Junkbuster installation, it's configuration and policies. It is
   used in many of the proxy-generated pages and its use is highly
   recommended in multi-user installations, since your users will want to
   know why certain content is blocked or modified. Default: Don't show a
   link to on-line documentation.
   
     proxy-info-url http://www.your-site.com/proxy.html
   
   "Listen-address" specifies the address and port where Junkbuster will
   listen for connections from your Web browser. The default is to listen
   on the localhost port 8118, and this is suitable for most users. (In
   your web browser, under proxy configuration, list the proxy server as
   "localhost" and the port as "8118").
   
   If you already have another service running on port 8118, or if you
   want to serve requests from other machines (e.g. on your local
   network) as well, you will need to override the default. The syntax is
   "listen-address [<ip-address>]:<port>". If you leave out the IP
   address, junkbuster will bind to all interfaces (addresses) on your
   machine and may become reachable from the Internet. In that case,
   consider using access control lists (acl's) (see "aclfile" above), or
   a firewall.
   
   For example, suppose you are running Junkbuster on a machine which has
   the address 192.168.0.1 on your local private network (192.168.0.0)
   and has another outside connection with a different address. You want
   it to serve requests from inside only:
   
     listen-address 192.168.0.1:8118
   
   If you want it to listen on all addresses (including the outside
   connection):
   
     listen-address :8118
   
   If you do this, consider using ACLs (see "aclfile" above). Note: you
   will need to point your browser(s) to the address and port that you
   have configured here. Default: localhost:8118 (127.0.0.1:8118).
   
   The debug option sets the level of debugging information to log in the
   logfile (and to the console in the Windows version). A debug level of
   1 is informative because it will show you each request as it happens.
   Higher levels of debug are probably only of interest to developers.
   
     debug         1 # GPC   = show each GET/POST/CONNECT request
     debug         2 # CONN  = show each connection status
     debug         4 # IO    = show I/O status
     debug         8 # HDR   = show header parsing
     debug        16 # LOG   = log all data into the logfile
     debug        32 # FRC   = debug force feature
     debug        64 # REF   = debug regular expression filter
     debug       128 #       = debug fast redirects
     debug       256 #       = debug GIF de-animation
     debug       512 # CLF   = Common Log Format
     debug      1024 #       = debug kill pop-ups
     debug      4096 # INFO  = Startup banner and warnings.
     debug      8192 # ERROR = Non-fatal errors
   
   It is highly recommended that you enable ERROR reporting (debug 8192),
   at least until the next stable release.
   
   The reporting of FATAL errors (i.e. ones which crash JunkBuster) is
   always on and cannot be disabled.
   
   If you want to use CLF (Common Log Format), you should set "debug 512"
   ONLY, do not enable anything else.
   
   Multiple "debug" directives, are OK - they're logical-OR'd together.
   
     debug 15 # same as setting the first 4 listed above
   
   Default:
   
     debug 1 # URLs
     debug 4096 # Info
     debug 8192 # Errors - *we highly recommended enabling this*
   
   Junkbuster normally uses "multi-threading", a software technique that
   permits it to handle many different requests simultaneously. In some
   cases you may wish to disable this -- particularly if you're trying to
   debug a problem. The "single-threaded" option forces Junkbuster to
   handle requests sequentially. Default: Multi-threaded mode.
   
     #single-threaded
   
   "toggle" allows you to temporarily disable all Junkbuster's filtering.
   Just set "toggle 0".
   
   The Windows version of Junkbuster puts an icon in the system tray,
   which also allows you to change this option. If you right-click on
   that icon (or select the "Options" menu), one choice is "Enable".
   Clicking on enable toggles Junkbuster on and off. This is useful if
   you want to temporarily disable Junkbuster, e.g., to access a site
   that requires cookies which you would otherwise have blocked. This can
   also be toggled via a web browser at the Junkbuster internal address
   of [44]http://i.j.b on any platform.
   
   "toggle 1" means Junkbuster runs normally, "toggle 0" means that
   Junkbuster becomes a non-anonymizing non-blocking proxy. Default: 1
   (on).
   
     toggle 1
   
   For content filtering, i.e. the "+filter" and "+deanimate-gif"
   actions, it is necessary that Junkbuster buffers the entire document
   body. This can be potentially dangerous, since a server could just
   keep sending data indefinitely and wait for your RAM to exhaust. With
   nasty consequences.
   
   The buffer-limit option lets you set the maximum size in Kbytes that
   each buffer may use. When the documents buffer exceeds this size, it
   is flushed to the client unfiltered and no further attempt to filter
   the rest of it is made. Remember that there may multiple threads
   running, which might require increasing the "buffer-limit" Kbytes
   each, unless you have enabled "single-threaded" above.
   
     buffer-limit 4069
   
   To enable the web-based ijb.action file editor set enable-edit-actions
   to 1, or 0 to disable. Note that you must have compiled JunkBuster
   with support for this feature, otherwise this option has no effect.
   This internal page can be reached at [45]http://i.j.b.
   
   Security note: If this is enabled, anyone who can use the proxy can
   edit the actions file, and their changes will affect all users. For
   shared proxies, you probably want to disable this. Default: enabled.
   
     enable-edit-actions 1
   
   Allow JunkBuster to be toggled on and off remotely, using your web
   browser. Set "enable-remote-toggle"to 1 to enable, and 0 to disable.
   Note that you must have compiled JunkBuster with support for this
   feature, otherwise this option has no effect.
   
   Security note: If this is enabled, anyone who can use the proxy can
   toggle it on or off (see [46]http://i.j.b), and their changes will
   affect all users. For shared proxies, you probably want to disable
   this. Default: enabled.
   
     enable-remote-toggle 1

3.3.3. Access Control List (ACL)

   Access controls are included at the request of some ISPs and systems
   administrators, and are not usually needed by individual users. Please
   note the warnings in the FAQ that this proxy is not intended to be a
   substitute for a firewall or to encourage anyone to defer addressing
   basic security weaknesses.
   
   If no access settings are specified, the proxy talks to anyone that
   connects. If any access settings file are specified, then the proxy
   talks only to IP addresses permitted somewhere in this file and not
   denied later in this file.
   
   Summary -- if using an ACL:
   
   Client must have permission to receive service.
   
   LAST match in ACL wins.
   
   Default behavior is to deny service.
   
   The syntax for an entry in the Access Control List is:
   
     ACTION    SRC_ADDR[/SRC_MASKLEN]    [ DST_ADDR[/DST_MASKLEN] ]
   
   Where the individual fields are:
   
    ACTION      = "permit-access" or "deny-access"
    SRC_ADDR    = client hostname or dotted IP address
    SRC_MASKLEN = number of bits in the subnet mask for the source
    DST_ADDR    = server or forwarder hostname or dotted IP address
    DST_MASKLEN = number of bits in the subnet mask for the target
   
   The field separator (FS) is whitespace (space or tab).
   
   IMPORTANT NOTE: If the junkbuster is using a forwarder (see below) or
   a gateway for a particular destination URL, the DST_ADDR that is
   examined is the address of the forwarder or the gateway and NOT the
   address of the ultimate target. This is necessary because it may be
   impossible for the local Junkbuster to determine the address of the
   ultimate target (that's often what gateways are used for).
   
   Here are a few examples to show how the ACL features work:
   
   "localhost" is OK -- no DST_ADDR implies that ALL destination
   addresses are OK:
   
     permit-access localhost
   
   A silly example to illustrate permitting any host on the class-C
   subnet with Junkbuster to go anywhere:
   
     permit-access www.junkbusters.com/24
   
   Except deny one particular IP address from using it at all:
   
     deny-access ident.junkbusters.com
   
   You can also specify an explicit network address and subnet mask.
   Explicit addresses do not have to be resolved to be used.
   
     permit-access 207.153.200.0/24
   
   A subnet mask of 0 matches anything, so the next line permits
   everyone.
   
     permit-access 0.0.0.0/0
   
   Note, you cannot say:
   
     permit-access .org
   
   to allow all *.org domains. Every IP address listed must resolve
   fully.
   
   An ISP may want to provide a Junkbuster that is accessible by "the
   world" and yet restrict use of some of their private content to hosts
   on its internal network (i.e. its own subscribers). Say, for instance
   the ISP owns the Class-B IP address block 123.124.0.0 (a 16 bit
   netmask). This is how they could do it:
   
    permit-access 0.0.0.0/0 0.0.0.0/0   # other clients can go anywhere
                                          # with the following exceptions
   :
   
    deny-access   0.0.0.0/0   123.124.0.0/16 # block all external request
   s for
                                             # sites on the ISP's network
    permit 0.0.0.0/0 www.my_isp.com        # except for the ISP's main
                                             # web site
    permit 123.124.0.0/16 0.0.0.0/0          # the ISP's clients can go
                                             # anywhere
   
   Note that if some hostnames are listed with multiple IP addresses, the
   primary value returned by DNS (via gethostbyname()) is used. Default:
   Anyone can access the proxy.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
3.3.4. Forwarding

   This feature allows chaining of HTTP requests via multiple proxies. It
   can be used to better protect privacy and confidentiality when
   accessing specific domains by routing requests to those domains to a
   special purpose filtering proxy such as lpwa.com. Or to use a caching
   proxy to speed up browsing.
   
   It can also be used in an environment with multiple networks to route
   requests via multiple gateways allowing transparent access to multiple
   networks without having to modify browser configurations.
   
   Also specified here are SOCKS proxies. Junkbuster SOCKS 4 and SOCKS
   4A. The difference is that SOCKS 4A will resolve the target hostname
   using DNS on the SOCKS server, not our local DNS client.
   
   The syntax of each line is:
   
    forward target_domain[:port] http_proxy_host[:port]
    forward-socks4 target_domain[:port] socks_proxy_host[:port]
   http_proxy_host[:port]
    forward-socks4a target_domain[:port] socks_proxy_host[:port]
   http_proxy_host[:port]
   
   If http_proxy_host is ".", then requests are not forwarded to a HTTP
   proxy but are made directly to the web servers.
   
   Lines are checked in sequence, and the last match wins.
   
   There is an implicit line equivalent to the following, which specifies
   that anything not finding a match on the list is to go out without
   forwarding or gateway protocol, like so:
   
     forward .* . # implicit
   
   In the following common configuration, everything goes to Lucent's
   LPWA, except SSL on port 443 (which it doesn't handle):
   
    forward .* lpwa.com:8000
    forward :443 .
   
   See the FAQ for instructions on how to automate the login procedure
   for LPWA. Some users have reported difficulties related to LPWA's use
   of "." as the last element of the domain, and have said that this can
   be fixed with this:
   
     forward lpwa. lpwa.com:8000
   
   (NOTE: the syntax for specifying target_domain has changed since the
   previous paragraph was written -- it will not work now. More
   information is welcome.)
   
   In this fictitious example, everything goes via an ISP's caching
   proxy, except requests to that ISP:
   
    forward .* caching.myisp.net:8000
    forward myisp.net .
   
   For the @home network, we're told the forwarding configuration is
   this:
   
     forward .* proxy:8080
   
   Also, we're told they insist on getting cookies and JavaScript, so you
   should add home.com to the cookie file. We consider JavaScript a
   security risk. Java need not be enabled.
   
   In this example direct connections are made to all "internal" domains,
   but everything else goes through Lucent's LPWA by way of the company's
   SOCKS gateway to the Internet.
   
    forward-socks4 .* lpwa.com:8000 firewall.my_company.com:1080
    forward my_company.com .
   
   This is how you could set up a site that always uses SOCKS but no
   forwarders:
   
     forward-socks4a .* . firewall.my_company.com:1080
   
   An advanced example for network administrators:
   
   If you have links to multiple ISPs that provide various special
   content to their subscribers, you can configure forwarding to pass
   requests to the specific host that's connected to that ISP so that
   everybody can see all of the content on all of the ISPs.
   
   This is a bit tricky, but here's an example:
   
   host-a has a PPP connection to isp-a.com. And host-b has a PPP
   connection to isp-b.com. host-a can run a Junkbuster proxy with
   forwarding like this:
   
    forward .* .
    forward isp-b.com host-b:8118
   
   host-b can run a Junkbuster proxy with forwarding like this:
   
    forward .* .
    forward isp-a.com host-a:8118
   
   Now, anyone on the Internet (including users on host-a and host-b) can
   set their browser's proxy to either host-a or host-b and be able to
   browse the content on isp-a or isp-b.
   
   Here's another practical example, for University of Kent at Canterbury
   students with a network connection in their room, who need to use the
   University's Squid web cache.
   
    forward *. ssbcache.ukc.ac.uk:3128  # Use the proxy, except for:
    forward .ukc.ac.uk .  # Anything on the same domain as us
    forward * .  # Host with no domain specified
    forward 129.12.*.* .  # A dotted IP on our /16 network.
    forward 127.*.*.* .  # Loopback address
    forward localhost.localdomain .  # Loopback address
    forward www.ukc.mirror.ac.uk .  # Specific host
   
   If you intend to chain Junkbuster and squid locally, then chain as
   browser -> squid -> junkbuster is the recommended way.
   
   Your squid configuration could then look like this:
   
     # Define junkbuster as parent cache
   
     cache_peer 127.0.0.1 parent 8118 0 no-query
   
     # Define ACL for protocol FTP
     acl FTP proto FTP
     # Do not forward ACL FTP to junkbuster
     always_direct allow FTP
     # Do not forward ACL CONNECT (https) to junkbuster
     always_direct allow CONNECT
     # Forward the rest to junkbuster
     never_direct allow all
     _________________________________________________________________
   
3.3.5. Windows GUI Options

   Junkbuster has a number of options specific to the Windows GUI
   interface:
   
   If "activity-animation" is set to 1, the Junkbuster icon will animate
   when "Junkbuster" is active. To turn off, set to 0.
   
     activity-animation 1
   
   If "log-messages" is set to 1, Junkbuster will log messages to the
   console window:
   
     log-messages 1
   
   If "log-buffer-size" is set to 1, the size of the log buffer, i.e. the
   amount of memory used for the log messages displayed in the console
   window, will be limited to "log-max-lines" (see below).
   
   Warning: Setting this to 0 will result in the buffer to grow
   infinitely and eat up all your memory!
   
     log-buffer-size 1
   
   log-max-lines is the maximum number of lines held in the log buffer.
   See above.
   
     log-max-lines 200
   
   If "log-highlight-messages" is set to 1, Junkbuster will highlight
   portions of the log messages with a bold-faced font:
   
     log-highlight-messages 1
   
   The font used in the console window:
   
     log-font-name Comic Sans MS
   
   Font size used in the console window:
   
     log-font-size 8
   
   "show-on-task-bar" controls whether or not Junkbuster will appear as a
   button on the Task bar when minimized:
   
     show-on-task-bar 0
   
   If "close-button-minimizes" is set to 1, the Windows close button will
   minimize Junkbuster instead of closing the program (close with the
   exit option on the File menu).
   
     close-button-minimizes 1
   
   The "hide-console" option is specific to the MS-Win console version of
   JunkBuster. If this option is used, Junkbuster will disconnect from
   and hide the command console.
   
     #hide-console
     _________________________________________________________________
   
3.4. The Actions File

   The "ijb.action" file (formerly actionsfile) is used to define what
   actions Junkbuster takes, and thus determines how images, cookies and
   various other aspects of HTTP content and transactions are handled.
   Images can be anything you want, including ads, banners, or just some
   obnoxious image that you would rather not see. Cookies can be accepted
   or rejected, or accepted only during the current browser session (i.e.
   not written to disk). Changes to ijb.action should be immediately
   visible to Junkbuster without the need to restart.
   
   To determine which actions apply to a request, the URL of the request
   is compared to all patterns in this file. Every time it matches, the
   list of applicable actions for the URL is incrementally updated. You
   can trace this process by visiting [47]http://i.j.b/show-url-info.
   
   The actions file can be edited with a browser by loading
   [48]http://i.j.b/, and then select "Edit Actions".
   
   There are four types of lines in this file: comments (begin with a "#"
   character), actions, aliases and patterns, all of which are explained
   below, as well as the configuration file syntax that Junkbuster
   understands.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
3.4.1. URL Domain and Path Syntax

   Generally, a pattern has the form <domain>/<path>, where both the
   <domain> and <path> part are optional. If you only specify a domain
   part, the "/" can be left out:
   
   www.example.com - is a domain only pattern and will match any request
   to "www.example.com".
   
   www.example.com/ - means exactly the same.
   
   www.example.com/index.html - matches only the single document
   "/index.html" on "www.example.com".
   
   /index.html - matches the document "/index.html", regardless of the
   domain.
   
   index.html - matches nothing, since it would be interpreted as a
   domain name and there is no top-level domain called ".html".
   
   The matching of the domain part offers some flexible options: if the
   domain starts or ends with a dot, it becomes unanchored at that end.
   For example:
   
   .example.com - matches any domain that ENDS in ".example.com".
   
   www. - matches any domain that STARTS with "www".
   
   Additionally, there are wild-cards that you can use in the domain
   names themselves. They work pretty similar to shell wild-cards: "*"
   stands for zero or more arbitrary characters, "?" stands for any
   single character. And you can define character classes in square
   brackets and they can be freely mixed:
   
   ad*.example.com - matches "adserver.example.com", "ads.example.com",
   etc but not "sfads.example.com".
   
   *ad*.example.com - matches all of the above, and then some.
   
   .?pix.com - matches "www.ipix.com", "pictures.epix.com",
   "a.b.c.d.e.upix.com", etc.
   
   www[1-9a-ez].example.com - matches "www1.example.com",
   "www4.example.com", "wwwd.example.com", "wwwz.example.com", etc., but
   not "wwww.example.com".
   
   If Junkbuster was compiled with "pcre" support (default), Perl
   compatible regular expressions can be used. See the pcre/docs/
   directory or "man perlre" (also available on
   [49]http://www.perldoc.com/perl5.6/pod/perlre.html) for details. A
   brief discussion of regular expressions is in the [50]Appendix. For
   instance:
   
   /.*/advert[0-9]+\.jpe?g - would match a URL from any domain, with any
   path that includes "advert" followed immediately by one or more
   digits, then a "." and ending in either "jpeg" or "jpg". So we match
   "example.com/ads/advert2.jpg", and
   "www.example.com/ads/banners/advert39.jpeg", but not
   "www.example.com/ads/banners/advert39.gif" (no gifs in the example
   pattern).
   
   Please note that matching in the path is case INSENSITIVE by default,
   but you can switch to case sensitive at any point in the pattern by
   using the "(?-i)" switch:
   
   www.example.com/(?-i)PaTtErN.* - will match only documents whose path
   starts with "PaTtErN" in exactly this capitalization.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
3.4.2. Actions

   Actions are enabled if preceded with a "+", and disabled if preceded
   with a "-". Actions are invoked by enclosing the action name in curly
   braces (e.g. {+some_action}), followed by a list of URLs to which the
   action applies. There are three classes of actions:
   
     * Boolean (e.g. "+/-block"):
         {+name}        # enable this action
         {-name}        # disable this action
       
     * parameterized (e.g. "+/-hide-user-agent"):
         {+name{param}}  # enable action and set parameter to "param"
         {-name}         # disable action
       
     * Multi-value (e.g. "{+/-add-header{Name: value}}",
       "{+/-wafer{name=value}}"):
         {+name{param}}   # enable action and add parameter "param"
         {-name{param}}   # remove the parameter "param"
         {-name}          # disable this action totally
       
   If nothing is specified in this file, no "actions" are taken. So in
   this case JunkBuster would just be a normal, non-blocking,
   non-anonymizing proxy. You must specifically enable the privacy and
   blocking features you need (although the provided default ijb.action
   file will give a good starting point).
   
   Later defined actions always over-ride earlier ones. For multi-valued
   actions, the actions are applied in the order they are specified.
   
   The list of valid Junkbuster "actions" are:
   
     * Add the specified HTTP header, which is not checked for validity.
       You may specify this many times to specify many different headers:
         +add-header{Name: value}
       
     * Block this URL totally.
         +block
       
     * De-animate all animated GIF images, i.e. reduce them to their last
       frame. This will also shrink the images considerably (in bytes,
       not pixels!). If the option "first" is given, the first frame of
       the animation is used as the replacement. If "last" is given, the
       last frame of the animation is used instead, which probably makes
       more sense for most banner animations, but also has the risk of
       not showing the entire last frame (if it is only a delta to an
       earlier frame).
         +deanimate-gifs{last}
         +deanimate-gifs{first}
       
     * "+downgrade" will downgrade HTTP/1.1 client requests to HTTP/1.0
       and downgrade the responses as well. Use this action for servers
       that use HTTP/1.1 protocol features that Junkbuster doesn't handle
       well yet. HTTP/1.1 is only partially implemented. Default is not
       to downgrade requests.
         +downgrade
       
     * Many sites, like yahoo.com, don't just link to other sites.
       Instead, they will link to some script on their own server, giving
       the destination as a parameter, which will then redirect you to
       the final target. URLs resulting from this scheme typically look
       like: http://some.place/some_script?http://some.where-else.
       Sometimes, there are even multiple consecutive redirects encoded
       in the URL. These redirections via scripts make your web browsing
       more traceable, since the server from which you follow such a link
       can see where you go to. Apart from that, valuable bandwidth and
       time is wasted, while your browser ask the server for one redirect
       after the other. Plus, it feeds the advertisers.
       The "+fast-redirects" option enables interception of these
       requests by Junkbuster, who will cut off all but the last valid
       URL in the request and send a local redirect back to your browser
       without contacting the remote site.
         +fast-redirects
       
     * Apply the filters in the section_header section of the
       re_filterfile file to the site(s). Re_filterfile sections are
       grouped according to like functionality.
        +filter{section_header}
       
       Filter sections that are pre-defined in the supplied re_filterfile
       include:
       
   html-annoyances: Get rid of particularly annoying HTML abuse.
   
   js-annoyances: Get rid of particularly annoying JavaScript abuse
   
   no-poups: Kill all popups in JS and HTML
   
   frameset-borders: Give frames a border
   
   webbugs: Squish WebBugs (1x1 invisible GIFs used for user tracking)
   
   no-refresh: Automatic refresh sucks on auto-dialup lines
   
   fun: Text replacements for subversive browsing fun!
   
   nimda: Remove (virus) Nimda code.
   
   banners-by-size: Kill banners by size
   
   crude-parental: Kill all web pages that contain the words "sex" or
   "warez"
   
     * Block any existing X-Forwarded-for header, and do not add a new
       one:
         +hide-forwarded
       
     * If the browser sends a "From:" header containing your e-mail
       address, this either completely removes the header ("block"), or
       changes it to the specified e-mail address.
         +hide-from{block}
         +hide-from{spam@sittingduck.xqq}
       
     * Don't send the "Referer:" (sic) header to the web site. You can
       block it, forge a URL to the same server as the request (which is
       preferred because some sites will not send images otherwise) or
       set it to a constant string of your choice.
         +hide-referer{block}
         +hide-referer{forge}
         +hide-referer{http://nowhere.com}
       
     * Alternative spelling of "+hide-referer". It has the same
       parameters, and can be freely mixed with, "+hide-referer".
       ("referrer" is the correct English spelling, however the HTTP
       specification has a bug - it requires it to be spelled "referer".)
         +hide-referrer{...}
       
     * Change the "User-Agent:" header so web servers can't tell your
       browser type. Warning! This breaks many web sites. Specify the
       user-agent value you want. Example, pretend to be using Netscape
       on Linux:
         +hide-user-agent{Mozilla (X11; I; Linux 2.0.32 i586)}
       
     * Treat this URL as an image. This only matters if it's also
       "+block"ed, in which case a "blocked" image can be sent rather
       than a HTML page. See "+image-blocker{}" below for the control
       over what is actually sent.
         +image
       
     * Decides what to do with URLs that end up tagged with "{+block
       +image}", e.g an advertizement. There are five options.
       "-image-blocker" will send a HTML "blocked" page, usually
       resulting in a "broken image" icon. "+image-blocker{logo}" will
       send a "JunkBuster" logo image. "+image-blocker{blank}" will send
       a 1x1 transparent GIF image. And finally,
       "+image-blocker{http://xyz.com}" will send a HTTP temporary
       redirect to the specified image. This has the advantage of the
       icon being being cached by the browser, which will speed up the
       display. "+image-blocker{pattern}" will send a checkboard type
       pattern, which scales better than the logo (which can get blocky
       if the browser enlarges it too much).
         +image-blocker{logo}
         +image-blocker{blank}
         +image-blocker{pattern}
         +image-blocker{http://i.j.b/send-banner}
       
     * By default (i.e. in the absence of a "+limit-connect" action),
       Junkbuster will only allow CONNECT requests to port 443, which is
       the standard port for https as a precaution.
       The CONNECT methods exists in HTTP to allow access to secure
       websites (https:// URLs) through proxies. It works very simply:
       the proxy connects to the server on the specified port, and then
       short-circuits its connections to the client and to the remote
       proxy. This can be a big security hole, since CONNECT-enabled
       proxies can be abused as TCP relays very easily.
       If you want to allow CONNECT for more ports than this, or want to
       forbid CONNECT altogether, you can specify a comma separated list
       of ports and port ranges (the latter using dashes, with the
       minimum defaulting to 0 and max to 65K):
         +limit-connect{443} # This is the default and need no be
       specified.
         +limit-connect{80,443} # Ports 80 and 443 are OK.
         +limit-connect{-3, 7, 20-100, 500-} # Port less than 3, 7, 20 to
       100
          #and above 500 are OK.
       
     * "+no-compression" prevents the website from compressing the data.
       Some websites do this, which can be a problem for Junkbuster,
       since "+filter", "+no-popup" and "+gif-deanimate" will not work on
       compressed data. This will slow down connections to those
       websites, though. Default is "nocompression" is turned on.
         +nocompression
       
     * If the website sets cookies, "no-cookies-keep" will make sure they
       are erased when you exit and restart your web browser. This makes
       profiling cookies useless, but won't break sites which require
       cookies so that you can log in for transactions. Default: on.
         +no-cookies-keep
       
     * Prevent the website from reading cookies:
         +no-cookies-read
       
     * Prevent the website from setting cookies:
         +no-cookies-set
       
     * Filter the website through a built-in filter to disable those
       obnoxious JavaScript pop-up windows via window.open(), etc. The
       two alternative spellings are equivalent.
         +no-popup
         +no-popups
       
     * This action only applies if you are using a jarfile for saving
       cookies. It sends a cookie to every site stating that you do not
       accept any copyright on cookies sent to you, and asking them not
       to track you. Of course, this is a (relatively) unique header they
       could use to track you.
         +vanilla-wafer
       
     * This allows you to add an arbitrary cookie. It can be specified
       multiple times in order to add as many cookies as you like.
         +wafer{name=value}
       
   The meaning of any of the above is reversed by preceding the action
   with a "-", in place of the "+".
   
   Some examples:
   
   Turn off cookies by default, then allow a few through for specified
   sites:
   
    # Turn off all persistent cookies
    { +no-cookies-read }
    { +no-cookies-set }
    # Allow cookies for this browser session ONLY
    { +no-cookies-keep }
    # Exceptions to the above, sites that benefit from persistent cookies
    { -no-cookies-read }
    { -no-cookies-set }
    { -no-cookies-keep }
    .javasoft.com
    .sun.com
    .yahoo.com
    .msdn.microsoft.com
    .redhat.com
    # Alternative way of saying the same thing
    {-no-cookies-set -no-cookies-read -no-cookies-keep}
    .sourceforge.net
    .sf.net
   
   Now turn off "fast redirects", and then we allow two exceptions:
   
    # Turn them off!
    {+fast-redirects}
   
    # Reverse it for these two sites, which don't work right without it.
    {-fast-redirects}
    www.ukc.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wac\.cgi\?
    login.yahoo.com
   
   Turn on page filtering according to rules in the defined sections of
   refilterfile, and make one exception for sourceforge:
   
    # Run everything through the filter file, using only the
    # specified sections:
    +filter{html-annoyances} +filter{js-annoyances} +filter{no-popups}\
    +filter{webbugs} +filter{nimda} +filter{banners-by-size}
   
    # Then disable filtering of code from sourceforge!
    {-filter}
    .cvs.sourceforge.net
   
   Now some URLs that we want "blocked", ie we won't see them. Many of
   these use regular expressions that will expand to match multiple URLs:
   
     # Blocklist:
     {+block}
     /.*/(.*[-_.])?ads?[0-9]?(/|[-_.].*|\.(gif|jpe?g))
     /.*/(.*[-_.])?count(er)?(\.cgi|\.dll|\.exe|[?/])
     /.*/(ng)?adclient\.cgi
     /.*/(plain|live|rotate)[-_.]?ads?/

3.4.3. Aliases

   Custom "actions", known to Junkbuster as "aliases", can be defined by
   combining other "actions". These can in turn be invoked just like the
   built-in "actions". Currently, an alias can contain any character
   except space, tab, "=", "{" or "}". But please use only "a"- "z",
   "0"-"9", "+", and "-". Alias names are not case sensitive, and must be
   defined before anything else in the ijb.actionfile ! And there can
   only be one set of "aliases" defined.
   
   Now let's define a few aliases:
   
    # Useful customer aliases we can use later. These must come first!
    {{alias}}
    +no-cookies = +no-cookies-set +no-cookies-read
    -no-cookies = -no-cookies-set -no-cookies-read
    fragile     = -block -no-cookies -filter -fast-redirects -hide-refere
   r -no-popups
    shop        = -no-cookies -filter -fast-redirects
    +imageblock = +block +image
    #For people who don't like to type too much:  ;-)
    c0 = +no-cookies
    c1 = -no-cookies
    c2 = -no-cookies-set +no-cookies-read
    c3 = +no-cookies-set -no-cookies-read
    #... etc.  Customize to your heart's content.
   
   Some examples using our "shop" and "fragile" aliases from above:
   
    # These sites are very complex and require
    # minimal interference.
    {fragile}
    .office.microsoft.com
    .windowsupdate.microsoft.com
    .nytimes.com
    # Shopping sites - still want to block ads.
    {shop}
    .quietpc.com
    .worldpay.com   # for quietpc.com
    .jungle.com
    .scan.co.uk
    # These shops require pop-ups
    {shop -no-popups}
    .dabs.com
    .overclockers.co.uk
     _________________________________________________________________
   
3.5. The Filter File

   Any web page can be dynamically modified with the filter file. This
   modification can be removal, or re-writing, of any web page content,
   including tags and non-visible content. The default filter file is
   re_filterfile, located in the config directory.
   
   The included example file is divided into sections. Each section
   begins with the FILTER keyword, followed by the identifier for that
   section, e.g. "FILTER: webbugs". Each section performs a similar type
   of filtering, such as "html-annoyances".
   
   This file uses regular expressions to alter or remove any string in
   the target page. The expressions can only operate on one line at a
   time. Some examples from the included default re_filterfile:
   
   Stop web pages from displaying annoying messages in the status bar by
   deleting such references:
   
    FILTER: html-annoyances
    # New browser windows should be resizeable and have a location and st
   atus
    # bar. Make it so.
    #
    s/resizable="?(no|0)"?/resizable=1/ig s/noresize/yesresize/ig
    s/location="?(no|0)"?/location=1/ig s/status="?(no|0)"?/status=1/ig
    s/scrolling="?(no|0|Auto)"?/scrolling=1/ig
    s/menubar="?(no|0)"?/menubar=1/ig
    # The <BLINK> tag was a crime!
    #
    s*<blink>|</blink>**ig
    # Is this evil?
    #
    #s/framespacing="?(no|0)"?//ig
    #s/margin(height|width)=[0-9]*//gi
   
   Just for kicks, replace any occurrence of "Microsoft" with
   "MicroSuck", and have a little fun with topical buzzwords:
   
    FILTER: fun
    s/microsoft(?!.com)/MicroSuck/ig
    # Buzzword Bingo:
    #
    s/industry-leading|cutting-edge|award-winning/<font color=red><b>BING
   O!</b></font>/ig
   
   Kill those pesky little web-bugs:
   
    # webbugs: Squish WebBugs (1x1 invisible GIFs used for user tracking)
    FILTER: webbugs
    s/<img\s+[^>]*?(width|height)\s*=\s*['"]?1\D[^>]*?(width|height)\s*=\
   s*['"]?1(\D[^>]*?)?>/<!-- Squished WebBug -->/sig
     _________________________________________________________________
   
3.6. Templates

   When Junkbuster displays one of its internal pages, such as a 404 Not
   Found error page, it uses the appropriate template. On Linux, BSD, and
   Unix, these are located in /etc/junkbuster/templates by default. These
   may be customized, if desired.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
4. Quickstart to Using Junkbuster

   Install package, then run and enjoy! JunkBuster is typically started
   by specifying the main configuration file to be used on the command
   line. Example Unix startup command:
   

 # /usr/sbin/junkbuster /etc/junkbuster/config


   An init script is provided for SuSE and Redhat.
   
   For for SuSE: /etc/rc.d/junkbuster start
   
   For RedHat: /etc/rc.d/init.d/junkbuster start
   
   If no configuration file is specified on the command line, Junkbuster
   will look for a file named config in the current directory. Except on
   Win32 where it will try config.txt. If no file is specified on the
   command line and no default configuration file can be found,
   Junkbuster will fail to start.
   
   Be sure your browser is set to use the proxy which is by default at
   localhost, port 8118. With Netscape (and Mozilla), this can be set
   under Edit -> Preferences -> Advanced -> Proxies -> HTTP Proxy. For
   Internet Explorer: Tools > Internet Properties -> Connections -> LAN
   Setting. Then, check "Use Proxy" and fill in the appropriate info
   (Address: localhost, Port: 8118). Include if HTTPS proxy support too.
   
   The included default configuration files should give a reasonable
   starting point, though may be somewhat aggressive in blocking junk.
   You will probably want to keep an eye out for sites that require
   persistent cookies, and add these to ijb.action as needed. By default,
   most of these will be accepted only during the current browser
   session, until you add them to the configuration. If you want the
   browser to handle this instead, you will need to edit ijb.action and
   disable this feature. If you use more than one browser, it would make
   more sense to let Junkbuster handle this. In which case, the
   browser(s) should be set to accept all cookies.
   
   If a particular site shows problems loading properly, try adding it to
   the {fragile} section of ijb.action. This will turn off most actions
   for this site.
   
   Junkbuster is HTTP/1.1 compliant, but not all 1.1 features are as yet
   implemented. If browsers that support HTTP/1.1 (like Mozilla or recent
   versions of I.E.) experience problems, you might try to force HTTP/1.0
   compatibility. For Mozilla, look under Edit -> Preferences -> Debug ->
   Networking. Or set the "+downgrade" config option in ijb.action.
   
   After running Junkbuster for a while, you can start to fine tune the
   configuration to suit your personal, or site, preferences and
   requirements. There are many, many aspects that can be customized.
   "Actions" (as specified in ijb.action) can be adjusted by pointing
   your browser to [51]http://i.j.b/, and then follow the link to "edit
   the actions list". (This is an internal page and does not require
   Internet access.)
   
   In fact, various aspects of Junkbuster configuration can be viewed
   from this page, including current configuration parameters, source
   code version numbers, the browser's request headers, and "actions"
   that apply to a given URL. In addition to the ijb.action file editor
   mentioned above, Junkbuster can also be turned "on" and "off" from
   this page.
   
   If you encounter problems, please verify it is a Junkbuster bug, by
   disabling Junkbuster, and then trying the same page. Also, try another
   browser if possible to eliminate browser or site problems. Before
   reporting it as a bug, see if there is not a configuration option that
   is enabled that is causing the page not to load. You can then add an
   exception for that page or site. If a bug, please report it to the
   developers (see below).
     _________________________________________________________________
   
4.1. Command Line Options

   JunkBuster may be invoked with the following command-line options:
   
     * --version
       Print version info and exit, Unix only.
     * --help
       Print a short usage info and exit, Unix only.
     * --no-daemon
       Don't become a daemon, i.e. don't fork and become process group
       leader, don't detach from controlling tty. Unix only.
     * --pidfile FILE
       On startup, write the process ID to FILE. Delete the FILE on exit.
       Failiure to create or delete the FILE is non-fatal. If no FILE
       option is given, no PID file will be used. Unix only.
     * --user USER[.GROUP]
       After (optionally) writing the PID file, assume the user ID of
       USER, and if included the GID of GROUP. Exit if the privileges are
       not sufficient to do so. Unix only.
     * configfile
       If no configfile is included on the command line, JunkBuster will
       look for a file named "config" in the current directory (except on
       Win32 where it will look for "config.txt" instead). Specify full
       path to avoid confusion.

5. Contacting the Developers, Bug Reporting and Feature Requests

   We value your feedback. However, to provide you with the best support,
   please note:
   
     * Use the [52]Sourceforge support forum to get help.
     * Submit bugs only thru our [53]Sourceforge bug forum. Make sure
       that the bug has not already been submitted. Please try to verify
       that it is a Junkbuster bug, and not a browser or site bug first.
       If you are using your own custom configuration, please try the
       stock configs to see if the problem is a configuration related
       bug. And if not using the latest development snapshot, please try
       the latest one. Or even better, CVS sources.
     * Submit feature requests only thru our [54]Sourceforge feature
       request forum.
       
   For any other issues, feel free to use the [55]mailing lists.

8. Appendix

8.1. Regular Expressions

   Junkbuster can use "regular expressions" in various config files.
   Assuming support for "pcre" (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions) is
   compiled in, which is the default. Such configuration directives do
   not require regular expressions, but they can be used to increase
   flexibility by matching a pattern with wild-cards against URLs.
   
   If you are reading this, you probably don't understand what "regular
   expressions" are, or what they can do. So this will be a very brief
   introduction only. A full explanation would require a book ;-)
   
   "Regular expressions" is a way of matching one character expression
   against another to see if it matches or not. One of the "expressions"
   is a literal string of readable characters (letter, numbers, etc), and
   the other is a complex string of literal characters combined with
   wild-cards, and other special characters, called meta-characters. The
   "meta-characters" have special meanings and are used to build the
   complex pattern to be matched against. Perl Compatible Regular
   Expressions is an enhanced form of the regular expression language
   with backward compatibility.
   
   To make a simple analogy, we do something similar when we use
   wild-card characters when listing files with the dir command in DOS.
   *.* matches all filenames. The "special" character here is the
   asterisk which matches any and all characters. We can be more specific
   and use ? to match just individual characters. So "dir file?.text"
   would match "file1.txt", "file2.txt", etc. We are pattern matching,
   using a similar technique to "regular expressions"!
   
   Regular expressions do essentially the same thing, but are much, much
   more powerful. There are many more "special characters" and ways of
   building complex patterns however. Let's look at a few of the common
   ones, and then some examples:
   
   . - Matches any single character, e.g. "a", "A", "4", ":", or "@".
   
   ? - The preceding character or expression is matched ZERO or ONE
   times. Either/or.
   
   + - The preceding character or expression is matched ONE or MORE
   times.
   
   * - The preceding character or expression is matched ZERO or MORE
   times.
   
   \ - The "escape" character denotes that the following character should
   be taken literally. This is used where one of the special characters
   (e.g. ".") needs to be taken literally and not as a special
   meta-character.
   
   [] - Characters enclosed in brackets will be matched if any of the
   enclosed characters are encountered.
   
   () - parentheses are used to group a sub-expression, or multiple
   sub-expressions.
   
   | - The "bar" character works like an "or" conditional statement. A
   match is successful if the sub-expression on either side of "|"
   matches.
   
   s/string1/string2/g - This is used to rewrite strings of text.
   "string1" is replaced by "string2" in this example.
   
   These are just some of the ones you are likely to use when matching
   URLs with Junkbuster, and is a long way from a definitive list. This
   is enough to get us started with a few simple examples which may be
   more illuminating:
   
   /.*/banners/.* - A simple example that uses the common combination of
   "." and "*" to denote any character, zero or more times. In other
   words, any string at all. So we start with a literal forward slash,
   then our regular expression pattern (".*") another literal forward
   slash, the string "banners", another forward slash, and lastly another
   ".*". We are building a directory path here. This will match any file
   with the path that has a directory named "banners" in it. The ".*"
   matches any characters, and this could conceivably be more forward
   slashes, so it might expand into a much longer looking path. For
   example, this could match:
   "/eye/hate/spammers/banners/annoy_me_please.gif", or just
   "/banners/annoying.html", or almost an infinite number of other
   possible combinations, just so it has "banners" in the path somewhere.
   
   A now something a little more complex:
   
   /.*/adv((er)?ts?|ertis(ing|ements?))?/ - We have several literal
   forward slashes again ("/"), so we are building another expression
   that is a file path statement. We have another ".*", so we are
   matching against any conceivable sub-path, just so it matches our
   expression. The only true literal that must match our pattern is adv,
   together with the forward slashes. What comes after the "adv" string
   is the interesting part.
   
   Remember the "?" means the preceding expression (either a literal
   character or anything grouped with "(...)" in this case) can exist or
   not, since this means either zero or one match. So
   "((er)?ts?|ertis(ing|ements?))" is optional, as are the individual
   sub-expressions: "(er)", "(ing|ements?)", and the "s". The "|" means
   "or". We have two of those. For instance, "(ing|ements?)", can expand
   to match either "ing" OR "ements?". What is being done here, is an
   attempt at matching as many variations of "advertisement", and
   similar, as possible. So this would expand to match just "adv", or
   "advert", or "adverts", or "advertising", or "advertisement", or
   "advertisements". You get the idea. But it would not match
   "advertizements" (with a "z"). We could fix that by changing our
   regular expression to: "/.*/adv((er)?ts?|erti(s|z)(ing|ements?))?/",
   which would then match either spelling.
   
   /.*/advert[0-9]+\.(gif|jpe?g) - Again another path statement with
   forward slashes. Anything in the square brackets "[]" can be matched.
   This is using "0-9" as a shorthand expression to mean any digit one
   through nine. It is the same as saying "0123456789". So any digit
   matches. The "+" means one or more of the preceding expression must be
   included. The preceding expression here is what is in the square
   brackets -- in this case, any digit one through nine. Then, at the
   end, we have a grouping: "(gif|jpe?g)". This includes a "|", so this
   needs to match the expression on either side of that bar character
   also. A simple "gif" on one side, and the other side will in turn
   match either "jpeg" or "jpg", since the "?" means the letter "e" is
   optional and can be matched once or not at all. So we are building an
   expression here to match image GIF or JPEG type image file. It must
   include the literal string "advert", then one or more digits, and a
   "." (which is now a literal, and not a special character, since it is
   escaped with "\"), and lastly either "gif", or "jpeg", or "jpg". Some
   possible matches would include: "//advert1.jpg",
   "/nasty/ads/advert1234.gif", "/banners/from/hell/advert99.jpg". It
   would not match "advert1.gif" (no leading slash), or "/adverts232.jpg"
   (the expression does not include an "s"), or "/advert1.jsp" ("jsp" is
   not in the expression anywhere).
   
   s/microsoft(?!.com)/MicroSuck/i - This is a substitution. "MicroSuck"
   will replace any occurrence of "microsoft". The "i" at the end of the
   expression means ignore case. The "(?!.com)" means the match should
   fail if "microsoft" is followed by ".com". In other words, this acts
   like a "NOT" modifier. In case this is a hyperlink, we don't want to
   break it ;-).
   
   We are barely scratching the surface of regular expressions here so
   that you can understand the default Junkbuster configuration files,
   and maybe use this knowledge to customize your own installation. There
   is much, much more that can be done with regular expressions. Now that
   you know enough to get started, you can learn more on your own :/

8.2. JunkBuster's Internal Pages

   Since JunkBuster proxies each requested web page, it is easy for
   JunkBuster to trap certain URLs. In this way, we can talk directly to
   JunkBuster, and see how it is configured, see how our rules are being
   applied, change these rules and other configuration options, and even
   turn JunkBuster's filtering off, all with a web browser.
   
   The URLs listed below are the special ones that allow direct access to
   JunkBuster. Of course, JunkBuster must be running to access these. If
   not, you will get a friendly error message.
   
     * Junkbuster main page:
       
     [69]http://ijbswa.sourceforge.net/config/
       Alternately, this may be reached at [70]http://i.j.b/, but this
       variation may not work as reliably as the above in some
       configurations.
     * Show information about the current configuration:
       
     [71]http://ijbswa.sourceforge.net/config/show-status
     * Show the source code version numbers:
       
     [72]http://ijbswa.sourceforge.net/config/show-version
     * Show the client's request headers:
       
     [73]http://ijbswa.sourceforge.net/config/show-request
     * Show which actions apply to a URL and why:
       
     [74]http://ijbswa.sourceforge.net/config/show-url-info
     * Toggle JunkBuster on or off:
       
     [75]http://ijbswa.sourceforge.net/config/toggle
       Short cuts. Turn off, then on:
       
     [76]http://ijbswa.sourceforge.net/config/toggle?set=disable
       
     [77]http://ijbswa.sourceforge.net/config/toggle?set=enable
     * Edit the actions list file:
       
     [78]http://ijbswa.sourceforge.net/config/edit-actions
       
   These may be bookmarked for quick reference.
