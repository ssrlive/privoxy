The user manual gives users information on how to install, configure and use 
Privoxy.

Privoxy is a web proxy with advanced filtering capabilities for protecting
privacy, filtering web page content, managing cookies, controlling access, and
removing ads, banners, pop-ups and other obnoxious Internet junk. Privoxy has a
very flexible configuration and can be customized to suit individual needs and
tastes. Privoxy has application for both stand-alone systems and multi-user
networks.

Privoxy is based on Internet Junkbuster (tm).

You can find the latest version of the user manual at http://www.privoxy.org/
user-manual/. Please see the Contact section on how to contact the developers.

1. Introduction

This documentation is included with the current beta version of Privoxy,
v.2.9.14, and is mostly complete at this point. The most up to date reference
for the time being is still the comments in the source files and in the
individual configuration files. Development of version 3.0 is currently nearing
completion, and includes many significant changes and enhancements over earlier
versions. The target release date for stable v3.0 is "soon" ;-).

Since this is a beta version, not all new features are well tested. This
documentation may be slightly out of sync as a result (especially with CVS
sources). And there may be bugs, though hopefully not many!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.1. Features

In addition to Internet Junkbuster's traditional features of ad and banner
blocking and cookie management, Privoxy provides new features, some of them
currently under development:

  * FIXME: complete the list of features. change the order: most important
    features to the top of the list. prefix new features with "NEW".
   
  * Integrated browser based configuration and control utility at http://
    config.privoxy.org/ (shortcut: http://p.p/). Browser-based tracing of rule
    and filter effects. Remote toggling.
   
  * Blocking of annoying pop-up browser windows.
   
  * HTTP/1.1 compliant (but not all optional 1.1 features are supported).
   
  * Support for Perl Compatible Regular Expressions in the configuration files,
    and generally a more sophisticated and flexible configuration syntax over
    previous versions.
   
  * GIF de-animation.
   
  * Web page content filtering (removes banners based on size, invisible
    "web-bugs", JavaScript and HTML annoyances, pop-ups, etc.)
   
  * Bypass many click-tracking scripts (avoids script redirection).
   
  * Multi-threaded (POSIX and native threads).
   
  * Auto-detection and re-reading of config file changes.
   
  * User-customizable HTML templates (e.g. 404 error page).
   
  * Improved cookie management features (e.g. session based cookies).
   
  * Improved signal handling, and a true daemon mode (Unix).
   
  * Every feature now controllable on a per-site or per-location basis,
    configuration more powerful and versatile over-all.
   
  * Many smaller new features added, limitations and bugs removed, and security
    holes fixed.
   
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Installation

Privoxy is available both in convenient pre-compiled packages for a wide range
of operating systems, and as raw source code. For most users, we recommend
using the packages, which can be downloaded from our Privoxy Project Page. For
installing and compiling the source code, please look into our Developer
Manual.

If you like to live on the bleeding edge and are not afraid of using possibly
unstable development versions, you can check out the up-to-the-minute version
directly from the CVS repository or simply download the nightly CVS tarball.
Again, we refer you to the Developer Manual.

At present, Privoxy is known to run on Windows(95, 98, ME, 2000, XP), Linux
(RedHat, Suse, Debian), Mac OSX, OS/2, AmigaOS, FreeBSD, NetBSD, BeOS, and many
more flavors of Unix.

Note: If you have a previous Junkbuster or Privoxy installation on your system,
you will need to remove it. Some platforms do this for you as part of their
installation procedure. (See below for your platform).

In any case be sure to backup your old configuration if it is valuable to you.
See the note to upgraders section below.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.1. Red Hat and SuSE RPMs

RPMs can be installed with rpm -Uvh privoxy-2.9.14-1.rpm, and will use /etc/
privoxy for the location of configuration files.

Note that on Red Hat, Privoxy will not be automatically started on system boot.
You will need to enable that using chkconfig, ntsysv, or similar methods. Note
that SuSE will automatically start Privoxy in the boot process.

If you have problems with failed dependencies, try rebuilding the SRC RPM: rpm
--rebuild privoxy-2.9.14-1.src.rpm;. This will use your locally installed
libraries and RPM version.

Also note that if you have a Junkbuster RPM installed on your system, you need
to remove it first, because the packages conflict. Otherwise, RPM will try to
remove Junkbuster automatically, before installing Privoxy.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.2. Debian

FIXME.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.3. Windows

Just double-click the installer, which will guide you through the installation
process. You will find the configuration files in the same directory as you
installed Privoxy in. We do not use the registry of Windows.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.4. Solaris, NetBSD, FreeBSD, HP-UX

Create a new directory, cd to it, then unzip and untar the archive. For the
most part, you'll have to figure out where things go. FIXME.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.5. OS/2

First, make sure that no previous installations of Junkbuster and / or Privoxy
are left on your system. You can do this by

Then, just double-click the WarpIN self-installing archive, which will guide
you through the installation process. A shadow of the Privoxy executable will
be placed in your startup folder so it will start automatically whenever OS/2
starts.

The directory you choose to install Privoxy into will contain all of the
configuration files.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.6. Max OSX

Unzip the downloaded package (you can either double-click on the file in the
finder, or on the desktop if you downloaded it there). Then, double-click on
the package installer icon and follow the installation process. Privoxy will be
installed in the subdirectory /Applications/Privoxy.app. Privoxy will set
itself up to start automatically on system bring-up via /System/Library/
StartupItems/Privoxy.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.7. AmigaOS

Copy and then unpack the lha archive to a suitable location. All necessary
files will be installed into Privoxy directory, including all configuration and
log files. To uninstall, just remove this directory.

Start Privoxy (with RUN <>NIL:) in your startnet script (AmiTCP), in s:
user-startup (RoadShow), as startup program in your startup script (Genesis),
or as startup action (Miami and MiamiDx). Privoxy will automatically quit when
you quit your TCP/IP stack (just ignore the harmless warning your TCP/IP stack
may display that Privoxy is still running).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Note to Upgraders

There are very significant changes from older versions of Junkbuster to the
current Privoxy. Configuration is substantially changed. Junkbuster 2.0.x and
earlier configuration files will not migrate. The functionality of the old
blockfile, cookiefile and imagelist, are now combined into the "actions files".
default.action, is the main actions file. Local exceptions should best be put
into user.action.

A "filter file" (typically default.filter) is new as of Privoxy 2.9.x, and
provides some of the new sophistication (explained below). config is much the
same as before.

If upgrading from a 2.0.x version, you will have to use the new config files,
and possibly adapt any personal rules from your older files. When porting
personal rules over from the old blockfile to the new actions files, please
note that even the pattern syntax has changed. If upgrading from 2.9.x
development versions, it is still recommended to use the new configuration
files.

A quick list of things to be aware of before upgrading:

  * The default listening port is now 8118 due to a conflict with another
    service (NAS).
   
  * Some installers may remove earlier versions completely. Save any important
    configuration files!
   
  * Privoxy is controllable with a web browser at the special URL: http://
    config.privoxy.org/ (Shortcut: http://p.p/). Many aspects of configuration
    can be done here, including temporarily disabling Privoxy.
   
  * The primary configuration file for cookie management, ad and banner
    blocking, and many other aspects of Privoxy configuration is in the actions
    files. It is strongly recommended to become familiar with the new actions
    concept below, before modifying these files. Locally defined rules should
    go into user.action.
   
  * Some installers may not automatically start Privoxy after installation.
   
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. Quickstart to Using Privoxy

  * Install Privoxy. See the section Installing.
   
  * Start Privoxy. See the section Starting Privoxy.
   
  * Change your browser's configuration to use the proxy localhost on port
    8118. See the section Starting Privoxy.
   
  * Enjoy surfing with enhanced comfort and privacy. Please see the section 
    Contacting the Developers on how to report bugs or problems with websites
    or to get help. You may want to change the file user.action to further
    tweak your new browsing experience.
   
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. Starting Privoxy

Before launching Privoxy for the first time, you will want to configure your
browser(s) to use Privoxy as a HTTP and HTTPS proxy. The default is localhost
for the proxy address, and port 8118 (earlier versions used port 8000). This is
the one configuration step that must be done!

With Netscape (and Mozilla), this can be set under Edit -> Preferences ->
Advanced -> Proxies -> HTTP Proxy. For Internet Explorer: Tools -> Internet
Properties -> Connections -> LAN Setting. Then, check "Use Proxy" and fill in
the appropriate info (Address: localhost, Port: 8118). Include if HTTPS proxy
support too.

After doing this, flush your browser's disk and memory caches to force a
re-reading of all pages and to get rid of any ads that may be cached. You are
now ready to start enjoying the benefits of using Privoxy!

Privoxy is typically started by specifying the main configuration file to be
used on the command line. If no configuration file is specified on the command
line, Privoxy will look for a file named config in the current directory.
Except on Win32 where it will try config.txt.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6.1. RedHat and Debian

We use a script. Note that RedHat does not start Privoxy upon booting per
default. It will use the file /etc/privoxy/config as its main configuration
file. FIXME: Debian??

 # /etc/rc.d/init.d/privoxy start                                              

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6.2. SuSE

We use a script. It will use the file /etc/privoxy/config as its main
configuration file. Note that SuSE starts Privoxy upon booting your PC.

 # rcprivoxy start                                                             

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6.3. Windows

Click on the Privoxy Icon to start Privoxy. If no configuration file is
specified on the command line, Privoxy will look for a file named config.txt.
Note that Windows will automatically start Privoxy upon booting you PC.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6.4. Solaris, NetBSD, FreeBSD, HP-UX and others

Example Unix startup command:

 # /usr/sbin/privoxy /etc/privoxy/config                                       

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6.5. OS/2

FIXME.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6.6. MAX OSX

FIXME.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6.7. AmigaOS

FIXME.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6.8. Command Line Options

Privoxy may be invoked with the following command-line options:

  * --version
   
    Print version info and exit. Unix only.
   
  * --help
   
    Print short usage info and exit. Unix only.
   
  * --no-daemon
   
    Don't become a daemon, i.e. don't fork and become process group leader, and
    don't detach from controlling tty. Unix only.
   
  * --pidfile FILE
   
    On startup, write the process ID to FILE. Delete the FILE on exit. Failure
    to create or delete the FILE is non-fatal. If no FILE option is given, no
    PID file will be used. Unix only.
   
  * --user USER[.GROUP]
   
    After (optionally) writing the PID file, assume the user ID of USER, and if
    included the GID of GROUP. Exit if the privileges are not sufficient to do
    so. Unix only.
   
  * configfile
   
    If no configfile is included on the command line, Privoxy will look for a
    file named "config" in the current directory (except on Win32 where it will
    look for "config.txt" instead). Specify full path to avoid confusion. If no
    config file is found, Privoxy will fail to start.
   
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. Privoxy Configuration

All Privoxy configuration is stored in text files. These files can be edited
with a text editor. Many important aspects of Privoxy can also be controlled
easily with a web browser.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7.1. Controlling Privoxy with Your Web Browser

Privoxy's user interface can be reached through the special URL http://
config.privoxy.org/ (shortcut: http://p.p/), which is a built-in page and works
without Internet access. You will see the following section: 

 Privoxy Menu                                                                  
        ??  View & change the current configuration                            
        ??  View the source code version numbers                               
        ??  View the request headers.                                          
        ??  Look up which actions apply to a URL and why                       
        ??  Toggle Privoxy on or off                                           
                                                                               

This should be self-explanatory. Note the first item leads to an editor for the
"actions list", which is where the ad, banner, cookie, and URL blocking magic
is configured as well as other advanced features of Privoxy. This is an easy
way to adjust various aspects of Privoxy configuration. The actions file, and
other configuration files, are explained in detail below.

"Toggle Privoxy On or Off" is handy for sites that might have problems with
your current actions and filters. You can in fact use it as a test to see
whether it is Privoxy causing the problem or not. Privoxy continues to run as a
proxy in this case, but all filtering is disabled. There is even a toggle 
Bookmarklet offered, so that you can toggle Privoxy with one click from your
browser.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7.2. Configuration Files Overview

For Unix, *BSD and Linux, all configuration files are located in /etc/privoxy/
by default. For MS Windows, OS/2, and AmigaOS these are all in the same
directory as the Privoxy executable. The name and number of configuration files
has changed from previous versions, and is subject to change as development
progresses.

The installed defaults provide a reasonable starting point, though some
settings may be aggressive by some standards. For the time being, the principle
configuration files are:

  * The main configuration file is named config on Linux, Unix, BSD, OS/2, and
    AmigaOS and config.txt on Windows. This is a required file.
   
  * default.action (the main actions file) is used to define the default
    settings for various "actions" relating to images, banners, pop-ups, access
    restrictions, banners and cookies.
   
    Multiple actions files may be defined in config. These are processed in the
    order they are defined. Local customizations and locally preferred
    exceptions to the default policies as defined in default.action are
    probably best applied in user.action, which should be preserved across
    upgrades. standard.action is also included. This is mostly for Privoxy's
    internal use.
   
    There is also a web based editor that can be accessed from http://
    config.privoxy.org/show-status/ (Shortcut: http://p.p/show-status/) for the
    various actions files.
   
  * default.filter (the filter file) can be used to re-write the raw page
    content, including viewable text as well as embedded HTML and JavaScript,
    and whatever else lurks on any given web page. The filtering jobs are only
    pre-defined here; whether to apply them or not is up to the actions files.
   
All files use the "#" character to denote a comment (the rest of the line will
be ignored) angd understand line continuation through placing a backslash ("\")
as the very last character in a line. If the # is preceded by a backslash, it
looses its special function. Placing a # in front of an otherwise valid
configuration line to prevent it from being interpreted is called "commenting
out" that line.

The actions files and default.filter can use Perl style regular expressions for
maximum flexibility.

After making any changes, there is no need to restart Privoxy in order for the
changes to take effect. Privoxy detects such changes automatically. Note,
however, that it may take one or two additional requests for the change to take
effect. When changing the listening address of Privoxy, these "wake up"
requests must obviously be sent to the old listening address.

While under development, the configuration content is subject to change. The
below documentation may not be accurate by the time you read this. Also, what
constitutes a "default" setting, may change, so please check all your
configuration files on important issues.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8. The Main Configuration File

Again, the main configuration file is named config on Linux/Unix/BSD and OS/2,
and config.txt on Windows. Configuration lines consist of an initial keyword
followed by a list of values, all separated by whitespace (any number of spaces
or tabs). For example:

  confdir /etc/privoxy
   

Assigns the value /etc/privoxy to the option confdir and thus indicates that
the configuration directory is named "/etc/privoxy/".

All options in the config file except for confdir and logdir are optional.
Watch out in the below description for what happens if you leave them unset.

The main config file controls all aspects of Privoxy's operation that are not
location dependent (i.e. they apply universally, no matter where you may be
surfing).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8.1. Configuration and Log File Locations

Privoxy can (and normally does) use a number of other files for additional
configuration, help and logging. This section of the configuration file tells
Privoxy where to find those other files.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8.1.1. confdir

Specifies:
   
    The directory where the other configuration files are located
   
Type of value:
   
    Path name
   
Default value:
   
    /etc/privoxy (Unix) or Privoxy installation dir (Windows)
   
Effect if unset:
   
    Mandatory
   
Notes:
   
    No trailing "/", please
   
    When development goes modular and multi-user, the blocker, filter, and
    per-user config will be stored in subdirectories of "confdir". For now, the
    configuration directory structure is flat, except for confdir/templates,
    where the HTML templates for CGI output reside (e.g. Privoxy's 404 error
    page).
   
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8.1.2. logdir

Specifies:
   
    The directory where all logging takes place (i.e. where logfile and jarfile
    are located)
   
Type of value:
   
    Path name
   
Default value:
   
    /var/log/privoxy (Unix) or Privoxy installation dir (Windows)
   
Effect if unset:
   
    Mandatory
   
Notes:
   
    No trailing "/", please
   
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8.1.3. actionsfile

Specifies:
   
    The actions file(s) to use
   
Type of value:
   
    File name, relative to confdir
   
Default value:
   
      standard     # Internal purposes, recommended not editing
                                                               
      default      # Main actions file                         
                                                               
      user         # User customizations                       
   
Effect if unset:
   
    No actions are taken at all. Simple neutral proxying.
   
Notes:
   
    Multiple actionsfile lines are permitted, and are in fact recommended!
   
    The default values include standard.action, which is used for internal
    purposes and should be loaded, default.action, which is the "main" actions
    file maintained by the developers, and user.action, where you can make your
    personal additions.
   
    Actions files are where all the per site and per URL configuration is done
    for ad blocking, cookie management, privacy considerations, etc. There is
    no point in using Privoxy without at least one actions file.
   
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8.1.4. filterfile

Specifies:
   
    The filter file to use
   
Type of value:
   
    File name, relative to confdir
   
Default value:
   
    default.filter (Unix) or default.filter.txt (Windows)
   
Effect if unset:
   
    No textual content filtering takes place, i.e. all +filter{name} actions in
    the actions files are turned off
   
Notes:
   
    The "default.filter" file contains content modification rules that use
    "regular expressions". These rules permit powerful changes on the content
    of Web pages, e.g., you could disable your favorite JavaScript annoyances,
    re-write the actual displayed text, or just have some fun replacing
    "Microsoft" with "MicroSuck" wherever it appears on a Web page.
   
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8.1.5. logfile

Specifies:
   
    The log file to use
   
Type of value:
   
    File name, relative to logdir
   
Default value:
   
    logfile (Unix) or privoxy.log (Windows)
   
Effect if unset:
   
    No log file is used, all log messages go to the console (stderr).
   
Notes:
   
    The windows version will additionally log to the console.
   
    The logfile is where all logging and error messages are written. The level
    of detail and number of messages are set with the debug option (see below).
    The logfile can be useful for tracking down a problem with Privoxy (e.g.,
    it's not blocking an ad you think it should block) but in most cases you
    probably will never look at it.
   
    Your logfile will grow indefinitely, and you will probably want to
    periodically remove it. On Unix systems, you can do this with a cron job
    (see "man cron"). For Red Hat, a logrotate script has been included.
   
    On SuSE Linux systems, you can place a line like "/var/log/privoxy.* +1024k
    644 nobody.nogroup" in /etc/logfiles, with the effect that cron.daily will
    automatically archive, gzip, and empty the log, when it exceeds 1M size.
   
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8.1.6. jarfile

Specifies:
   
    The file to store intercepted cookies in
   
Type of value:
   
    File name, relative to logdir
   
Default value:
   
    jarfile (Unix) or privoxy.jar (Windows)
   
Effect if unset:
   
    Intercepted cookies are not stored at all.
   
Notes:
   
    The jarfile may grow to ridiculous sizes over time.
   
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8.1.7. trustfile

Specifies:
   
    The trust file to use
   
Type of value:
   
    File name, relative to confdir
   
Default value:
   
    Unset (commented out). When activated: trust (Unix) or trust.txt (Windows)
   
Effect if unset:
   
    The whole trust mechanism is turned off.
   
Notes:
   
    The trust mechanism is an experimental feature for building white-lists and
    should be used with care. It is NOT recommended for the casual user.
   
    If you specify a trust file, Privoxy will only allow access to sites that
    are named in the trustfile. You can also mark sites as trusted referrers
    (with +), with the effect that access to untrusted sites will be granted,
    if a link from a trusted referrer was used. The link target will then be
    added to the "trustfile". Possible applications include limiting Internet
    access for children.
   
    If you use + operator in the trust file, it may grow considerably over
    time.
   
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8.1.8. user-manual

Specifies:
   
    Location of the Privoxy User Manual.
   
Type of value:
   
    A fully qualified URI
   
Default value:
   
    http://www.privoxy.org/user-manual/
   
Effect if unset:
   
    The default will be used.
   
Notes:
   
    The User Manual is used for help hints from some of the internal CGI pages.
    It is normally packaged with the binary distributions, and would make more
    sense to have this pointed at a locally installed copy.
   
    A more useful example (Unix):
   
      user-manual  file:///usr/share/doc/privoxy-2.9.14/user-manual/
   
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8.2. Local Set-up Documentation

If you intend to operate Privoxy for more users that just yourself, it might be
a good idea to let them know how to reach you, what you block and why you do
that, your policies etc.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8.2.1. trust-info-url

Specifies:
   
    A URL to be displayed in the error page that users will see if access to an
    untrusted page is denied.
   
Type of value:
   
    URL
   
Default value:
   
    Two example URL are provided
   
Effect if unset:
   
    No links are displayed on the "untrusted" error page.
   
Notes:
   
    The value of this option only matters if the experimental trust mechanism
    has been activated. (See trustfile above.)
   
    If you use the trust mechanism, it is a good idea to write up some on-line
    documentation about your trust policy and to specify the URL(s) here. Use
    multiple times for multiple URLs.
   
    The URL(s) should be added to the trustfile as well, so users don't end up
    locked out from the information on why they were locked out in the first
    place!
   
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8.2.2. admin-address

Specifies:
   
    An email address to reach the proxy administrator.
   
Type of value:
   
    Email address
   
Default value:
   
    Unset
   
Effect if unset:
   
    No email address is displayed on error pages and the CGI user interface.
   
Notes:
   
    If both admin-address and proxy-info-url are unset, the whole "Local
    Privoxy Support" box on all generated pages will not be shown.
   
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8.2.3. proxy-info-url

Specifies:
   
    A URL to documentation about the local Privoxy setup, configuration or
    policies.
   
Type of value:
   
    URL
   
Default value:
   
    Unset
   
Effect if unset:
   
    No link to local documentation is displayed on error pages and the CGI user
    interface.
   
Notes:
   
    If both admin-address and proxy-info-url are unset, the whole "Local
    Privoxy Support" box on all generated pages will not be shown.
   
    This URL shouldn't be blocked ;-)
   
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8.3. Debugging

These options are mainly useful when tracing a problem. Note that you might
also want to invoke Privoxy with the --no-daemon command line option when
debugging.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8.3.1. debug

Specifies:
   
    Key values that determine what information gets logged.
   
Type of value:
   
    Integer values
   
Default value:
   
    12289 (i.e.: URLs plus informational and warning messages)
   
Effect if unset:
   
    Nothing gets logged.
   
Notes:
   
    The available debug levels are:
   
      debug         1 # show each GET/POST/CONNECT request             
      debug         2 # show each connection status                    
      debug         4 # show I/O status                                
      debug         8 # show header parsing                            
      debug        16 # log all data into the logfile                  
      debug        32 # debug force feature                            
      debug        64 # debug regular expression filter                
      debug       128 # debug fast redirects                           
      debug       256 # debug GIF de-animation                         
      debug       512 # Common Log Format                              
      debug      1024 # debug kill pop-ups                             
      debug      4096 # Startup banner and warnings.                   
      debug      8192 # Non-fatal errors                               
   
    To select multiple debug levels, you can either add them or use multiple
    debug lines.
   
    A debug level of 1 is informative because it will show you each request as
    it happens. 1, 4096 and 8192 are highly recommended so that you will notice
    when things go wrong. The other levels are probably only of interest if you
    are hunting down a specific problem. They can produce a hell of an output
    (especially 16).
   
    The reporting of fatal errors (i.e. ones which crash Privoxy) is always on
    and cannot be disabled.
   
    If you want to use CLF (Common Log Format), you should set "debug 512" ONLY
    and not enable anything else.
   
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8.3.2. single-threaded

Specifies:
   
    Whether to run only one server thread
   
Type of value:
   
    None
   
Default value:
   
    Unset
   
Effect if unset:
   
    Multi-threaded (or, where unavailable: forked) operation, i.e. the ability
    to serve multiple requests simultaneously.
   
Notes:
   
    This option is only there for debug purposes and you should never need to
    use it. It will drastically reduce performance.
   
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8.4. Access Control and Security

This section of the config file controls the security-relevant aspects of
Privoxy's configuration.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8.4.1. listen-address

Specifies:
   
    The IP address and TCP port on which Privoxy will listen for client
    requests.
   
Type of value:
   
    [IP-Address]:Port
   
Default value:
   
    localhost:8118
   
Effect if unset:
   
    Bind to localhost (127.0.0.1), port 8118. This is suitable and recommended
    for home users who run Privoxy on the same machine as their browser.
   
Notes:
   
    You will need to configure your browser(s) to this proxy address and port.
   
    If you already have another service running on port 8118, or if you want to
    serve requests from other machines (e.g. on your local network) as well,
    you will need to override the default.
   
    If you leave out the IP address, Privoxy will bind to all interfaces
    (addresses) on your machine and may become reachable from the Internet. In
    that case, consider using access control lists (ACL's) (see "ACLs" below),
    or a firewall.
   
Example:
   
    Suppose you are running Privoxy on a machine which has the address
    192.168.0.1 on your local private network (192.168.0.0) and has another
    outside connection with a different address. You want it to serve requests
    from inside only:
   
      listen-address  192.168.0.1:8118                                 
   
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8.4.2. toggle

Specifies:
   
    Initial state of "toggle" status
   
Type of value:
   
    1 or 0
   
Default value:
   
    1
   
Effect if unset:
   
    Act as if toggled on
   
Notes:
   
    If set to 0, Privoxy will start in "toggled off" mode, i.e. behave like a
    normal, content-neutral proxy. See enable-remote-toggle below. This is not
    really useful anymore, since toggling is much easier via the web interface
    than via editing the conf file.
   
    The windows version will only display the toggle icon in the system tray if
    this option is present.
   
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8.4.3. enable-remote-toggle

Specifies:
   
    Whether or not the web-based toggle feature may be used
   
Type of value:
   
    0 or 1
   
Default value:
   
    1
   
Effect if unset:
   
    The web-based toggle feature is disabled.
   
Notes:
   
    When toggled off, Privoxy acts like a normal, content-neutral proxy, i.e.
    it acts as if none of the actions applied to any URL.
   
    For the time being, access to the toggle feature can not be controlled
    separately by "ACLs" or HTTP authentication, so that everybody who can
    access Privoxy (see "ACLs" and listen-address above) can toggle it for all
    users. So this option is not recommended for multi-user environments with
    untrusted users.
   
    Note that you must have compiled Privoxy with support for this feature,
    otherwise this option has no effect.
   
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8.4.4. enable-edit-actions

Specifies:
   
    Whether or not the web-based actions file editor may be used
   
Type of value:
   
    0 or 1
   
Default value:
   
    1
   
Effect if unset:
   
    The web-based actions file editor is disabled.
   
Notes:
   
    For the time being, access to the editor can not be controlled separately
    by "ACLs" or HTTP authentication, so that everybody who can access Privoxy
    (see "ACLs" and listen-address above) can modify its configuration for all
    users. So this option is not recommended for multi-user environments with
    untrusted users.
   
    Note that you must have compiled Privoxy with support for this feature,
    otherwise this option has no effect.
   
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8.4.5. ACLs: permit-access and deny-access

Specifies:
   
    Who can access what.
   
Type of value:
   
    src_addr[/src_masklen] [dst_addr[/dst_masklen]]
   
    Where src_addr and dst_addr are IP addresses in dotted decimal notation or
    valid DNS names, and src_masklen and dst_masklen are subnet masks in CIDR
    notation, i.e. integer values from 2 to 30 representing the length (in
    bits) of the network address. The masks and the whole destination part are
    optional.
   
Default value:
   
    Unset
   
Effect if unset:
   
    Don't restrict access further than implied by listen-address
   
Notes:
   
    Access controls are included at the request of ISPs and systems
    administrators, and are not usually needed by individual users. For a
    typical home user, it will normally suffice to ensure that Privoxy only
    listens on the localhost or internal (home) network address by means of the
    listen-address option.
   
    Please see the warnings in the FAQ that this proxy is not intended to be a
    substitute for a firewall or to encourage anyone to defer addressing basic
    security weaknesses.
   
    Multiple ACL lines are OK. If any ACLs are specified, then the Privoxy
    talks only to IP addresses that match at least one permit-access line and
    don't match any subsequent deny-access line. In other words, the last match
    wins, with the default being deny-access.
   
    If Privoxy is using a forwarder (see forward below) for a particular
    destination URL, the dst_addr that is examined is the address of the
    forwarder and NOT the address of the ultimate target. This is necessary
    because it may be impossible for the local Privoxy to determine the IP
    address of the ultimate target (that's often what gateways are used for).
   
    You should prefer using IP addresses over DNS names, because the address
    lookups take time. All DNS names must resolve! You can not use domain
    patterns like "*.org" or partial domain names. If a DNS name resolves to
    multiple IP addresses, only the first one is used.
   
    Denying access to particular sites by ACL may have undesired side effects
    if the site in question is hosted on a machine which also hosts other
    sites.
   
Examples:
   
    Explicitly define the default behavior if no ACL and listen-address are
    set: "localhost" is OK. The absence of a dst_addr implies that all
    destination addresses are OK:
   
      permit-access  localhost                                         
   
    Allow any host on the same class C subnet as www.privoxy.org access to
    nothing but www.example.com:
   
      permit-access  www.privoxy.org/24 www.example.com/32             
   
    Allow access from any host on the 26-bit subnet 192.168.45.64 to anywhere,
    with the exception that 192.168.45.73 may not access
    www.dirty-stuff.example.com:
   
      permit-access  192.168.45.64/26                                  
      deny-access    192.168.45.73    www.dirty-stuff.example.com      
   
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8.4.6. buffer-limit

Specifies:
   
    Maximum size of the buffer for content filtering.
   
Type of value:
   
    Size in Kbytes
   
Default value:
   
    4096
   
Effect if unset:
   
    Use a 4MB (4096 KB) limit.
   
Notes:
   
    For content filtering, i.e. the +filter and +deanimate-gif actions, it is
    necessary that Privoxy buffers the entire document body. This can be
    potentially dangerous, since a server could just keep sending data
    indefinitely and wait for your RAM to exhaust -- with nasty consequences.
    Hence this option.
   
    When a document buffer size reaches the buffer-limit, it is flushed to the
    client unfiltered and no further attempt to filter the rest of the document
    is made. Remember that there may be multiple threads running, which might
    require up to buffer-limit Kbytes each, unless you have enabled
    "single-threaded" above.
   
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8.5. Forwarding

This feature allows routing of HTTP requests through a chain of multiple
proxies. It can be used to better protect privacy and confidentiality when
accessing specific domains by routing requests to those domains through an
anonymous public proxy (see e.g. http://www.multiproxy.org/anon_list.htm) Or to
use a caching proxy to speed up browsing. Or chaining to a parent proxy may be
necessary because the machine that Privoxy runs on has no direct Internet
access.

Also specified here are SOCKS proxies. Privoxy supports the SOCKS 4 and SOCKS
4A protocols.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8.5.1. forward

Specifies:
   
    To which parent HTTP proxy specific requests should be routed.
   
Type of value:
   
    target_domain[:port] http_parent[/port]
   
    Where target_domain is a domain name pattern (see the chapter on domain
    matching in the default.action file), http_parent is the address of the
    parent HTTP proxy as an IP addresses in dotted decimal notation or as a
    valid DNS name (or "." to denote "no forwarding", and the optional port
    parameters are TCP ports, i.e. integer values from 1 to 64535
   
Default value:
   
    Unset
   
Effect if unset:
   
    Don't use parent HTTP proxies.
   
Notes:
   
    If http_parent is ".", then requests are not forwarded to another HTTP
    proxy but are made directly to the web servers.
   
    Multiple lines are OK, they are checked in sequence, and the last match
    wins.
   
Examples:
   
    Everything goes to an example anonymizing proxy, except SSL on port 443
    (which it doesn't handle):
   
      forward   .*     anon-proxy.example.org:8080                     
      forward   :443   .                                               
   
    Everything goes to our example ISP's caching proxy, except for requests to
    that ISP's sites:
   
      forward   .*.                caching-proxy.example-isp.net:8000  
      forward   .example-isp.net   .                                   
   
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8.5.2. forward-socks4 and forward-socks4a

Specifies:
   
    Through which SOCKS proxy (and to which parent HTTP proxy) specific
    requests should be routed.
   
Type of value:
   
    target_domain[:port] socks_proxy[/port] http_parent[/port]
   
    Where target_domain is a domain name pattern (see the chapter on domain
    matching in the default.action file), http_parent and socks_proxy are IP
    addresses in dotted decimal notation or valid DNS names (http_parent may be
    "." to denote "no HTTP forwarding"), and the optional port parameters are
    TCP ports, i.e. integer values from 1 to 64535
   
Default value:
   
    Unset
   
Effect if unset:
   
    Don't use SOCKS proxies.
   
Notes:
   
    Multiple lines are OK, they are checked in sequence, and the last match
    wins.
   
    The difference between forward-socks4 and forward-socks4a is that in the
    SOCKS 4A protocol, the DNS resolution of the target hostname happens on the
    SOCKS server, while in SOCKS 4 it happens locally.
   
    If http_parent is ".", then requests are not forwarded to another HTTP
    proxy but are made (HTTP-wise) directly to the web servers, albeit through
    a SOCKS proxy.
   
Examples:
   
    From the company example.com, direct connections are made to all "internal"
    domains, but everything outbound goes through their ISP's proxy by way of
    example.com's corporate SOCKS 4A gateway to the Internet.
   
      forward-socks4a   .*.            socks-gw.example.com:1080  www-cache.example-isp.net:8080 
      forward           .example.com   .                                                         
   
    A rule that uses a SOCKS 4 gateway for all destinations but no HTTP parent
    looks like this:
   
      forward-socks4   .*.            socks-gw.example.com:1080  .     
   
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8.5.3. Advanced Forwarding Examples

If you have links to multiple ISPs that provide various special content only to
their subscribers, you can configure multiple Privoxies which have connections
to the respective ISPs to act as forwarders to each other, so that your users
can see the internal content of all ISPs.

Assume that host-a has a PPP connection to isp-a.net. And host-b has a PPP
connection to isp-b.net. Both run Privoxy. Their forwarding configuration can
look like this:

host-a:

  forward    .*.         .                                                     
  forward    .isp-b.net  host-b:8118                                           

host-b:

  forward    .*.         .                                                     
  forward    .isp-a.net  host-a:8118                                           

Now, your users can set their browser's proxy to use either host-a or host-b
and be able to browse the internal content of both isp-a and isp-b.

If you intend to chain Privoxy and squid locally, then chain as browser ->
squid -> privoxy is the recommended way.

Assuming that Privoxy and squid run on the same box, your squid configuration
could then look like this:

  # Define Privoxy as parent proxy (without ICP)                               
  cache_peer 127.0.0.1 parent 8118 7 no-query                                  
                                                                               
  # Define ACL for protocol FTP                                                
  acl ftp proto FTP                                                            
                                                                               
  # Do not forward FTP requests to Privoxy                                     
  always_direct allow ftp                                                      
                                                                               
  # Forward all the rest to Privoxy                                            
  never_direct allow all                                                       

You would then need to change your browser's proxy settings to squid's address
and port. Squid normally uses port 3128. If unsure consult http_port in
squid.conf.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8.6. Windows GUI Options

Privoxy has a number of options specific to the Windows GUI interface:

If "activity-animation" is set to 1, the Privoxy icon will animate when
"Privoxy" is active. To turn off, set to 0.

  activity-animation 1
   

If "log-messages" is set to 1, Privoxy will log messages to the console window:

  log-messages 1
   

If "log-buffer-size" is set to 1, the size of the log buffer, i.e. the amount
of memory used for the log messages displayed in the console window, will be
limited to "log-max-lines" (see below).

Warning: Setting this to 0 will result in the buffer to grow infinitely and eat
up all your memory!

  log-buffer-size 1
   

log-max-lines is the maximum number of lines held in the log buffer. See above.

  log-max-lines 200
   

If "log-highlight-messages" is set to 1, Privoxy will highlight portions of the
log messages with a bold-faced font:

  log-highlight-messages 1
   

The font used in the console window:

  log-font-name Comic Sans MS
   

Font size used in the console window:

  log-font-size 8
   

"show-on-task-bar" controls whether or not Privoxy will appear as a button on
the Task bar when minimized:

  show-on-task-bar 0
   

If "close-button-minimizes" is set to 1, the Windows close button will minimize
Privoxy instead of closing the program (close with the exit option on the File
menu).

  close-button-minimizes 1
   

The "hide-console" option is specific to the MS-Win console version of Privoxy.
If this option is used, Privoxy will disconnect from and hide the command
console.

  #hide-console
   

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9. Actions Files

The actions files are used to define what actions Privoxy takes for which URLs,
and thus determines how ad images, cookies and various other aspects of HTTP
content and transactions are handled, and on which sites (or even parts
thereof). There are three such files included with Privoxy (as of version
2.9.15), with differing purposes:

  * standard.action - is used by the web based editor, to set various
    pre-defined sets of rules for the default actions section in
    default.action. These have increasing levels of aggressiveness. It is not
    recommend to edit this file.
   
  * default.action - is the primary action file that sets the initial values
    for all actions. It is intended to provide a base level of functionality
    for Privoxy's array of features. So it is a set of broad rules that should
    work reasonably well for users everywhere. This is the file that the
    developers are keeping updated, and making available to users.
   
  * user.action - is intended to be for local site preferences and exceptions.
    As an example, if your ISP or your bank has specific requirements, and need
    special handling, this kind of thing should go here. This file will not be
    upgraded.
   
The list of actions files to be used are defined in the main configuration
file, and are processed in the order they are defined. The content of these can
all be viewed and edited from http://config.privoxy.org/show-status.

An actions file typically has sections. Near the top, "aliases" are optionally
defined (discussed below), then the default set of rules which will apply
universally to all sites and pages. And then below that, exceptions to the
defined universal policies.

Actions can be used to block anything you want, including ads, banners, or just
some obnoxious URL that you would rather not see. Cookies can be accepted or
rejected, or accepted only during the current browser session (i.e. not written
to disk), content can be modified, JavaScripts tamed, user-tracking fooled, and
much more. See below for a complete list of actions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9.1. Finding the Right Mix

Note that some actions, like cookie suppression or script disabling, may render
some sites unusable that rely on these techniques to work properly. Finding the
right mix of actions is not always easy and certainly a matter of personal
taste. In general, it can be said that the more "aggressive" your default
settings (in the top section of the actions file) are, the more exceptions for
"trusted" sites you will have to make later. If, for example, you want to kill
popup windows per default, you'll have to make exceptions from that rule for
sites that you regularly use and that require popups for actually useful
content, like maybe your bank, favorite shop, or newspaper.

We have tried to provide you with reasonable rules to start from in the
distribution actions files. But there is no general rule of thumb on these
things. There just are too many variables, and sites are constantly changing.
Sooner or later you will want to change the rules (and read this chapter again
:).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9.2. How to Edit

The easiest way to edit the "actions" files is with a browser by using our
browser-based editor, which can be reached from http://config.privoxy.org/
show-status.

If you prefer plain text editing to GUIs, you can of course also directly edit
the the actions files.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9.3. How Actions are Applied to URLs

Actions files are divided into sections. There are special sections, like the "
alias" sections which will be discussed later. For now let's concentrate on
regular sections: They have a heading line (often split up to multiple lines
for readability) which consist of a list of actions, separated by whitespace
and enclosed in curly braces. Below that, there is a list of URL patterns, each
on a separate line.

To determine which actions apply to a request, the URL of the request is
compared to all patterns in this file. Every time it matches, the list of
applicable actions for the URL is incrementally updated, using the heading of
the section in which the pattern is located. If multiple matches for the same
URL set the same action differently, the last match wins. If not, the effects
are aggregated (e.g. a URL might match both the "+handle-as-image" and "+block"
actions).

You can trace this process by visiting http://config.privoxy.org/show-url-info.

More detail on this is provided in the Appendix, Anatomy of an Action.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9.4. Patterns

Generally, a pattern has the form <domain>/<path>, where both the <domain> and
<path> are optional. (This is why the pattern / matches all URLs).

www.example.com/
   
    is a domain-only pattern and will match any request to www.example.com,
    regardless of which document on that server is requested.
   
www.example.com
   
    means exactly the same. For domain-only patterns, the trailing / may be
    omitted.
   
www.example.com/index.html
   
    matches only the single document /index.html on www.example.com.
   
/index.html
   
    matches the document /index.html, regardless of the domain, i.e. on any web
    server.
   
index.html
   
    matches nothing, since it would be interpreted as a domain name and there
    is no top-level domain called .html.
   
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9.4.1. The Domain Pattern

The matching of the domain part offers some flexible options: if the domain
starts or ends with a dot, it becomes unanchored at that end. For example:

.example.com
   
    matches any domain that ENDS in .example.com
   
www.
   
    matches any domain that STARTS with www.
   
.example.
   
    matches any domain that CONTAINS .example. (Correctly speaking: It matches
    any FQDN that contains example as a domain.)
   
Additionally, there are wild-cards that you can use in the domain names
themselves. They work pretty similar to shell wild-cards: "*" stands for zero
or more arbitrary characters, "?" stands for any single character, you can
define character classes in square brackets and all of that can be freely
mixed:

ad*.example.com
   
    matches "adserver.example.com", "ads.example.com", etc but not
    "sfads.example.com"
   
*ad*.example.com
   
    matches all of the above, and then some.
   
.?pix.com
   
    matches www.ipix.com, pictures.epix.com, a.b.c.d.e.upix.com etc.
   
www[1-9a-ez].example.c*
   
    matches www1.example.com, www4.example.cc, wwwd.example.cy,
    wwwz.example.com etc., but not wwww.example.com.
   
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9.4.2. The Path Pattern

Privoxy uses Perl compatible regular expressions (through the PCRE library) for
matching the path.

There is an Appendix with a brief quick-start into regular expressions, and
full (very technical) documentation on PCRE regex syntax is available on-line
at http://www.pcre.org/man.txt. You might also find the Perl man page on
regular expressions (man perlre) useful, which is available on-line at http://
www.perldoc.com/perl5.6/pod/perlre.html.

Note that the path pattern is automatically left-anchored at the "/", i.e. it
matches as if it would start with a "^" (regular expression speak for the
beginning of a line).

Please also note that matching in the path is case INSENSITIVE by default, but
you can switch to case sensitive at any point in the pattern by using the "(?
-i)" switch: www.example.com/(?-i)PaTtErN.* will match only documents whose
path starts with PaTtErN in exactly this capitalization.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9.5. Actions

All actions are disabled by default, until they are explicitly enabled
somewhere in an actions file. Actions are turned on if preceded with a "+", and
turned off if preceded with a "-". So a "+action" means "do that action", e.g.
"+block" means please "block the following URL patterns".

Actions are invoked by enclosing the action name in curly braces (e.g.
{+some_action}), followed by a list of URLs (or patterns that match URLs) to
which the action applies. There are three classes of actions:

  * Boolean, i.e the action can only be "on" or "off". Examples:
   
      {+name}        # enable this action
      {-name}        # disable this action
         
   
  * Parameterized, e.g. "+/-hide-user-agent{ Mozilla 1.0 }", where some value
    is required in order to enable this type of action. Examples:
   
      {+name{param}}  # enable action and set parameter to "param"
      {-name}         # disable action ("parameter") can be omitted
         
   
  * Multi-value, e.g. "{+/-add-header{Name: value}}" or "{+/-send-wafer{name=
    value}}"), where some value needs to be defined in addition to simply
    enabling the action. Examples:
   
      {+name{param=value}}   # enable action and set "param" to "value"
      {-name{param=value}}   # remove the parameter "param" completely
      {-name}                # disable this action totally and remove param too
         
   
If nothing is specified in any actions file, no "actions" are taken. So in this
case Privoxy would just be a normal, non-blocking, non-anonymizing proxy. You
must specifically enable the privacy and blocking features you need (although
the provided default actions files will give a good starting point).

Later defined actions always over-ride earlier ones. So exceptions to any rules
you make, should come in the latter part of the file (or in a file that is
processed later when using multiple actions files). For multi-valued actions,
the actions are applied in the order they are specified. Actions files are
processed in the order they are defined in config (the default installation has
three actions files). It also quite possible for any given URL pattern to match
more than one action!

The list of valid Privoxy "actions" are:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9.5.1. +add-header

Type:
   
    Multi-value.
   
Typical uses:
   
    Send a user defined HTTP header to the web server.
   
Possible values:
   
    Any value is possible. Validity of the defined HTTP headers is not checked.
   
Example usage:
   
         {+add-header{X-User-Tracking: sucks}}
         .example.com
        
   
Notes:
   
    This action may be specified multiple times, in order to define multiple
    headers. This is rarely needed for the typical user. If you don't know what
    "HTTP headers" are, you definitely don't need to worry about this one.
   
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9.5.2. +block

Type:
   
    Boolean.
   
Typical uses:
   
    Used to block a URL from reaching your browser. The URL may be anything,
    but is typically used to block ads or other obnoxious content.
   
Possible values:
   
    N/A
   
Example usage:
   
         {+block}
         .banners.example.com
         .ads.r.us
        
   
Notes:
   
    If a URL matches one of the blocked patterns, Privoxy will intercept the
    URL and display its special "BLOCKED" page instead. If there is sufficient
    space, a large red banner will appear with a friendly message about why the
    page was blocked, and a way to go there anyway. If there is insufficient
    space a smaller "BLOCKED" page will appear without the red banner. Click
    here to view the default blocked HTML page (Privoxy must be running for
    this to work as intended!).
   
    A very important exception is if the URL matches both "+block" and 
    "+handle-as-image", then it will be handled by "+set-image-blocker" (see
    below). It is important to understand this process, in order to understand
    how Privoxy is able to deal with ads and other objectionable content.
   
    The "+filter" action can also perform some of the same functionality as
    "+block", but by virtue of very different programming techniques, and is
    most often used for different reasons.
   
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9.5.3. +deanimate-gifs

Type:
   
    Parameterized.
   
Typical uses:
   
    To stop those annoying, distracting animated GIF images.
   
Possible values:
   
    "last" or "first"
   
Example usage:
   
          {+deanimate-gifs{last}}
          .example.com
        
   
Notes:
   
    De-animate all animated GIF images, i.e. reduce them to their last frame.
    This will also shrink the images considerably (in bytes, not pixels!). If
    the option "first" is given, the first frame of the animation is used as
    the replacement. If "last" is given, the last frame of the animation is
    used instead, which probably makes more sense for most banner animations,
    but also has the risk of not showing the entire last frame (if it is only a
    delta to an earlier frame).
   
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9.5.4. +downgrade-http-version

Type:
   
    Boolean.
   
Typical uses:
   
    "+downgrade-http-version" will downgrade HTTP/1.1 client requests to HTTP/
    1.0 and downgrade the responses as well.
   
Possible values:
   
    N/A
   
Example usage:
   
         {+downgrade-http-version}
         .example.com
        
   
Notes:
   
    Use this action for servers that use HTTP/1.1 protocol features that
    Privoxy doesn't handle well yet. HTTP/1.1 is only partially implemented.
    Default is not to downgrade requests. This is an infrequently needed
    action, and is used to help with rare problem sites only.
   
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9.5.5. +fast-redirects

Type:
   
    Boolean.
   
Typical uses:
   
    The "+fast-redirects" action enables interception of "redirect" requests
    from one server to another, which are used to track users.Privoxy can cut
    off all but the last valid URL in a redirect request and send a local
    redirect back to your browser without contacting the intermediate site(s).
   
Possible values:
   
    N/A
   
Example usage:
   
         {+fast-redirects}
         .example.com
        
   
Notes:
   
    Many sites, like yahoo.com, don't just link to other sites. Instead, they
    will link to some script on their own server, giving the destination as a
    parameter, which will then redirect you to the final target. URLs resulting
    from this scheme typically look like: http://some.place/some_script?http://
    some.where-else.
   
    Sometimes, there are even multiple consecutive redirects encoded in the
    URL. These redirections via scripts make your web browsing more traceable,
    since the server from which you follow such a link can see where you go to.
    Apart from that, valuable bandwidth and time is wasted, while your browser
    ask the server for one redirect after the other. Plus, it feeds the
    advertisers.
   
    This is a normally "on" feature, and often requires exceptions for sites
    that are sensitive to defeating this mechanism.
   
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9.5.6. +filter

Type:
   
    Parameterized.
   
Typical uses:
   
    Apply page filtering as defined by named sections of the default.filter
    file to the specified site(s). "Filtering" can be any modification of the
    raw page content, including re-writing or deletion of content.
   
Possible values:
   
    "+filter" must include the name of one of the section identifiers from
    default.filter (or whatever filterfile is specified in config).
   
Example usage (from the current default.filter):
   
    +filter{html-annoyances}: Get rid of particularly annoying HTML abuse.
   
    +filter{js-annoyances}: Get rid of particularly annoying JavaScript abuse
   
    +filter{content-cookies}: Kill cookies that come in the HTML or JS content
   
    +filter{popups}: Kill all popups in JS and HTML
   
    +filter{frameset-borders}: Give frames a border and make them resizable
   
    +filter{webbugs}: Squish WebBugs (1x1 invisible GIFs used for user         
    tracking)                                                                  
   
    +filter{refresh-tags}: Kill automatic refresh tags (for dial-on-demand     
    setups)                                                                    
   
    +filter{fun}: Text replacements for subversive browsing fun!
   
    +filter{nimda}: Remove Nimda (virus) code.
   
    +filter{banners-by-size}: Kill banners by size (very efficient!)
   
    +filter{shockwave-flash}: Kill embedded Shockwave Flash objects
   
    +filter{crude-parental}: Kill all web pages that contain the words "sex" or
    "warez"                                                                    
   
Notes:
   
    This is potentially a very powerful feature! And requires a knowledge of
    regular expressions if you want to "roll your own". Filtering operates on a
    line by line basis throughout the entire page.
   
    Filtering requires buffering the page content, which may appear to slow
    down page rendering since nothing is displayed until all content has passed
    the filters. (It does not really take longer, but seems that way since the
    page is not incrementally displayed.) This effect will be more noticeable
    on slower connections.
   
    Filtering can achieve some of the effects as the "+block" action, i.e. it
    can be used to block ads and banners. In the overall scheme of things,
    filtering is one of the first things "Privoxy" does with a web page. So
    other most other actions are applied to the already "filtered" page.
   
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9.5.7. +hide-forwarded-for-headers

Type:
   
    Boolean.
   
Typical uses:
   
    Block any existing X-Forwarded-for HTTP header, and do not add a new one.
   
Possible values:
   
    N/A
   
Example usage:
   
         {+hide-forwarded-for-headers}
         .example.com
        
   
Notes:
   
    It is fairly safe to leave this on. It does not seem to break many sites.
   
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9.5.8. +hide-from-header

Type:
   
    Parameterized.
   
Typical uses:
   
    To block the browser from sending your email address in a "From:" header.
   
Possible values:
   
    Keyword: "block", or any user defined value.
   
Example usage:
   
         {+hide-from-header{block}}
         .example.com
        
   
Notes:
   
    The keyword "block" will completely remove the header (not to be confused
    with the "+block" action). Alternately, you can specify any value you
    prefer to send to the web server.
   
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9.5.9. +hide-referer

Type:
   
    Parameterized.
   
Typical uses:
   
    Don't send the "Referer:" (sic) HTTP header to the web site. Or,
    alternately send a forged header instead.
   
Possible values:
   
    Prevent the header from being sent with the keyword, "block". Or, "forge" a
    URL to one from the same server as the request. Or, set to user defined
    value of your choice.
   
Example usage:
   
         {+hide-referer{forge}}
         .example.com
        
   
Notes:
   
    "forge" is the preferred option here, since some servers will not send
    images back otherwise.
   
    "+hide-referrer" is an alternate spelling of "+hide-referer". It has the
    exact same parameters, and can be freely mixed with, "+hide-referer".
    ("referrer" is the correct English spelling, however the HTTP specification
    has a bug - it requires it to be spelled as "referer".)
   
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9.5.10. +hide-user-agent

Type:
   
    Parameterized.
   
Typical uses:
   
    To change the "User-Agent:" header so web servers can't tell your browser
    type. Who's business is it anyway?
   
Possible values:
   
    Any user defined string.
   
Example usage:
   
         {+hide-user-agent{Netscape 6.1 (X11; I; Linux 2.4.18 i686)}}
         .msn.com
        
   
Notes:
   
    Warning! This breaks many web sites that depend on this in order to
    determine how the target browser will respond to various requests. Use with
    caution.
   
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9.5.11. +handle-as-image

Type:
   
    Boolean.
   
Typical uses:
   
    To define what Privoxy should treat automatically as an image, and is an
    important ingredient of how ads are handled.
   
Possible values:
   
    N/A
   
Example usage:
   
         {+handle-as-image}
         /.*\.(gif|jpg|jpeg|png|bmp|ico)
        
   
Notes:
   
    This only has meaning if the URL (or pattern) also is "+block"ed, in which
    case a user definable image can be sent rather than a HTML page. This is
    integral to the whole concept of ad blocking: the URL must match both a 
    "+block" rule, and "+handle-as-image". (See "+set-image-blocker" below for
    control over what will actually be displayed by the browser.)
   
    There is little reason to change the default definition for this action.
   
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9.5.12. +set-image-blocker

Type:
   
    Parameterized.
   
Typical uses:
   
    Decide what to do with URLs that end up tagged with both "+block" and 
    "+handle-as-image", e.g an advertisement.
   
Possible values:
   
    There are four available options: "-set-image-blocker" will send a HTML
    "blocked" page, usually resulting in a "broken image" icon.
    "+set-image-blocker{blank}" will send a 1x1 transparent GIF image.
    "+set-image-blocker{pattern}" will send a checkerboard type pattern (the
    default). And finally, "+set-image-blocker{http://xyz.com}" will send a
    HTTP temporary redirect to the specified image. This has the advantage of
    the icon being being cached by the browser, which will speed up the
    display.
   
Example usage:
   
         {+set-image-blocker{blank}}
         .example.com
        
   
Notes:
   
    If you want invisible ads, they need to meet criteria as matching both
    images and blocked actions. And then, "image-blocker" should be set to
    "blank" for invisibility. Note you cannot treat HTML pages as images in
    most cases. For instance, frames require an HTML page to display. So a
    frame that is an ad, typically cannot be treated as an image. Forcing an
    "image" in this situation just will not work reliably.
   
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9.5.13. +limit-connect

Type:
   
    Parameterized.
   
Typical uses:
   
    By default, Privoxy only allows HTTP CONNECT requests to port 443 (the
    standard, secure HTTPS port). Use "+limit-connect" to disable this
    altogether, or to allow more ports.
   
Possible values:
   
    Any valid port number, or port number range.
   
Example usages:
   
         +limit-connect{443}                       #
     This is the default and need not be specified.
         +limit-connect{80,443}                  # Ports 80 and 443 are OK.
         +limit-connect{-3, 7, 20-100, 500-}   #
     Port less than 3, 7, 20 to 100 and above 500 are OK.
        
   
Notes:
   
    The CONNECT methods exists in HTTP to allow access to secure websites
    (https:// URLs) through proxies. It works very simply: the proxy connects
    to the server on the specified port, and then short-circuits its
    connections to the client and to the remote proxy. This can be a big
    security hole, since CONNECT-enabled proxies can be abused as TCP relays
    very easily.
   
    If you want to allow CONNECT for more ports than this, or want to forbid
    CONNECT altogether, you can specify a comma separated list of ports and
    port ranges (the latter using dashes, with the minimum defaulting to 0 and
    max to 65K).
   
    If you don't know what any of this means, there probably is no reason to
    change this one.
   
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9.5.14. +prevent-compression

Type:
   
    Boolean.
   
Typical uses:
   
    Prevent the specified websites from compressing HTTP data.
   
Possible values:
   
    N/A
   
Example usage:
   
         {+prevent-compression}
         .example.com
        
   
Notes:
   
    Some websites do this, which can be a problem for Privoxy, since "+filter",
    "+kill-popups" and "+gif-deanimate" will not work on compressed data. This
    will slow down connections to those websites, though. Default typically is
    to turn "prevent-compression" on.
   
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9.5.15. +session-cookies-only

Type:
   
    Boolean.
   
Typical uses:
   
    Allow cookies for the current browser session only.
   
Possible values:
   
    N/A
   
Example usage (disabling):
   
         {-session-cookies-only}
         .example.com
        
   
Notes:
   
    If websites set cookies, "+session-cookies-only" will make sure they are
    erased when you exit and restart your web browser. This makes profiling
    cookies useless, but won't break sites which require cookies so that you
    can log in for transactions. This is generally turned on for all sites, and
    is the recommended setting.
   
    "+prevent-*-cookies" actions should be turned off as well (see below), for
    "+session-cookies-only" to work. Or, else no cookies will get through at
    all. For, "persistent" cookies that survive across browser sessions, see
    below as well.
   
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9.5.16. +prevent-reading-cookies

Type:
   
    Boolean.
   
Typical uses:
   
    Explicitly prevent the web server from reading any cookies on your system.
   
Possible values:
   
    N/A
   
Example usage:
   
         {+prevent-reading-cookies}
         .example.com
        
   
Notes:
   
    Often used in conjunction with "+prevent-setting-cookies" to disable
    cookies completely. Note that "+session-cookies-only" requires these to
    both be disabled (or else it never gets any cookies to cache).
   
    For "persistent" cookies to work (i.e. they survive across browser sessions
    and reboots), all three cookie settings should be "off" for the specified
    sites.
   
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9.5.17. +prevent-setting-cookies

Type:
   
    Boolean.
   
Typical uses:
   
    Explicitly block the web server from storing cookies on your system.
   
Possible values:
   
    N/A
   
Example usage:
   
         {+prevent-setting-cookies}
         .example.com
        
   
Notes:
   
    Often used in conjunction with "+prevent-reading-cookies" to disable
    cookies completely (see above).
   
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9.5.18. +kill-popups

Type:
   
    Boolean.
   
Typical uses:
   
    Stop those annoying JavaScript pop-up windows!
   
Possible values:
   
    N/A
   
Example usage:
   
         {+kill-popups}
         .example.com
        
   
Notes:
   
    "+kill-popups" uses a built in filter to disable pop-ups that use the
    window.open() function, etc. This is one of the first actions processed by
    Privoxy as it contacts the remote web server. This action is not always
    100% reliable, and is supplemented by "+filter{popups}".
   
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9.5.19. +send-vanilla-wafer

Type:
   
    Boolean.
   
Typical uses:
   
    Sends a cookie for every site stating that you do not accept any copyright
    on cookies sent to you, and asking them not to track you.
   
Possible values:
   
    N/A
   
Example usage:
   
         {+send-vanilla-wafer}
         .example.com
        
   
Notes:
   
    This action only applies if you are using a jarfile for saving cookies. Of
    course, this is a (relatively) unique header and could conceivably be used
    to track you.
   
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9.5.20. +send-wafer

Type:
   
    Multi-value.
   
Typical uses:
   
    This allows you to send an arbitrary, user definable cookie.
   
Possible values:
   
    User specified cookie name and corresponding value.
   
Example usage:
   
         {+send-wafer{name=value}}
         .example.com
        
   
Notes:
   
    This can be specified multiple times in order to add as many cookies as you
    like.
   
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9.5.21. Summary

Note that many of these actions have the potential to cause a page to
misbehave, possibly even not to display at all. There are many ways a site
designer may choose to design his site, and what HTTP header content, and other
criteria, he may depend on. There is no way to have hard and fast rules for all
sites. See the Appendix for a brief example on troubleshooting actions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9.5.22. Sample Actions Files

Remember that the meaning of any of the above references is reversed by
preceding the action with a "-", in place of the "+". Also, that some actions
are turned on in the default section of the actions file, and require little to
no additional configuration. These are just "on".

But, other actions that are turned on in the default section do typically
require exceptions to be listed in the latter sections of one of our actions
file. For instance, by default no URLs are "blocked" (i.e. in the default
definitions of default.action). We need exceptions to this in order to enable
ad blocking in the lower sections. But we need to be very selective about what
we do block. Thus, the default is "off" for blocking.

Below is a liberally commented sample default.action file to demonstrate how
all the pieces come together. And to show how exceptions to the default
policies can be handled. This is followed by a brief user.action with similar
examples.

# Sample default.action file <developers@privoxy.org>

##########################################################################
# Aliases must be defined *before* they are used. These are

 .sourceforge.net
   

So far we are painting with a broad brush by setting general policies. The
above would be a reasonable starting point for many situations. Now, we want to
be more specific and have customized rules that are more suitable to our
personal habits and preferences. These would be for narrowly defined situations
like your ISP or your bank, and should be placed in user.action, which is
parsed after all other actions files and should not be clobbered by upgrades.
So any settings here, will have the last word and over-ride any previously
defined actions.

Now a few examples of some things that one might do with a user.action file.

# Sample user.action file.

# Any aliases you want to use need to be re-defined here.
# Alias to turn off cookie handling, ie allow all cookies unmolested.
 -prevent-cookies = -prevent-setting-cookies -prevent-reading-cookies \
                    -session-cookies-only

# Fragile sites should have the minimum changes:
 fragile     = -block -deanimate-gifs -fast-redirects -filter -hide-referer \
               -prevent-cookies -kill-popups

# Allow persistent cookies for a few regular sites that we 
# trust via our above alias. These will be saved from one browser session 
# to the next. We are explicity turning off any and all cookie handling, 
# even though the prevent-*-cookie settings were disabled in our above 
# default.action anyway. So cookies from these domains will come through 
# unmolested.
 { -prevent-cookies }
 .sun.com
 .yahoo.com
 .msdn.microsoft.com
 .redhat.com


# My ISP uses obnoxious self promoting images on many pages.
# Nuke them :) Note that "+handle-as-image" need not be specified,
# since all URLs ending in .gif will be tagged as images by the
# general rules in default.action anyway.
 { +block }
 www.my-isp-example.com/logo[0-9].gif


# Say the site where you do your homebanking needs to open
# popup windows, but you have chosen to kill popups by
# default. This will allow it for your-example-bank.com:
#
 { -filter{popups} -kill-popups }
 .my-example-bank.com


# This site is delicate, and requires kid-glove 
# treatment.
 { fragile }
 .forbes.com
   

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9.6. Aliases

Custom "actions", known to Privoxy as "aliases", can be defined by combining
other "actions". These can in turn be invoked just like the built-in "actions".
Currently, an alias can contain any character except space, tab, "=", "{" or "}
". But please use only "a"- "z", "0"-"9", "+", and "-". Alias names are not
case sensitive, and must be defined before other actions in the actions file!
And there can only be one set of "aliases" defined per file. Each actions file
may have its own aliases, but they are only visible within that file. Aliases
do not requir a "+" or "-" sign in front, since they are merely expanded.

Now let's define a few aliases:

 # Useful custom aliases we can use later. These must come first!
 {{alias}}
 +prevent-cookies = +prevent-setting-cookies +prevent-reading-cookies
 -prevent-cookies = -prevent-setting-cookies -prevent-reading-cookies
 fragile     =
 -block -prevent-cookies -filter -fast-redirects -hide-referer -kill-popups
 shop        = -prevent-cookies -filter -fast-redirects
 +imageblock = +block +handle-as-image

 # Aliases defined from other aliases, for people who don't like to type 
 # too much:  ;-)
 c0 = +prevent-cookies
 c1 = -prevent-cookies
 #... etc.  Customize to your heart's content.
   

Some examples using our "shop" and "fragile" aliases from above. These would
appear in the lower sections of an actions file as exceptions to the default
actions (as defined in the upper section):

 # These sites are very complex and require
 # minimal interference.
 {fragile}
  .office.microsoft.com
  .windowsupdate.microsoft.com
  .nytimes.com

 # Shopping sites - but we still want to block ads.
 {shop}
  .quietpc.com
  .worldpay.com   # for quietpc.com
  .scan.co.uk

 # These shops require pop-ups also 
 {shop -kill-popups}
  .dabs.com
  .overclockers.co.uk
   

The "shop" and "fragile" aliases are often used for "problem" sites that
require most actions to be disabled in order to function properly. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10. The Filter File

Any web page can be dynamically modified with the filter file. This
modification can be removal, or re-writing, of any web page content, including
tags and non-visible content. The default filter file is oddly enough
default.filter, located in the config directory.

This is potentially a very powerful feature, and requires knowledge of both
"regular expression" and HTML in order create custom filters. But, there are a
number of useful filters included with Privoxy for many common situations.

The included example file is divided into sections. Each section begins with
the FILTER keyword, followed by the identifier for that section, e.g. "FILTER:
webbugs". Each section performs a similar type of filtering, such as
"html-annoyances".

This file uses regular expressions to alter or remove any string in the target
page. The expressions can only operate on one line at a time. Some examples
from the included default default.filter:

Stop web pages from displaying annoying messages in the status bar by deleting
such references:

 FILTER: html-annoyances

 # New browser windows should be resizeable and have a location and status
 # bar. Make it so.
 #
 s/resizable="?(no|0)"?/resizable=1/ig s/noresize/yesresize/ig
 s/location="?(no|0)"?/location=1/ig s/status="?(no|0)"?/status=1/ig
 s/scrolling="?(no|0|Auto)"?/scrolling=1/ig
 s/menubar="?(no|0)"?/menubar=1/ig 

 # The <BLINK> tag was a crime!
 #
 s*<blink>|</blink>**ig

 # Is this evil? 
 #
 #s/framespacing="?(no|0)"?//ig
 #s/margin(height|width)=[0-9]*//gi
   

Just for kicks, replace any occurrence of "Microsoft" with "MicroSuck", and
have a little fun with topical buzzwords:

 FILTER: fun

 s/microsoft(?!.com)/MicroSuck/ig

 # Buzzword Bingo:
 #
 s/industry-leading|cutting-edge|award-winning/<font color=red><b>BINGO!</b></
font>/ig
   

Kill those pesky little web-bugs:

 # webbugs: Squish WebBugs (1x1 invisible GIFs used for user tracking)
 FILTER: webbugs

 s/<img\s+[^>]*?(width|height)\s*=\s*['"]?1\D[^>]*?(width|height)\s*=\s*['"]?1
(\D[^>]*?)?>/<!-- Squished WebBug -->/sig
   

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10.1. The +filter Action

Filters are enabled with the "+filter" action from within one of the actions
files. "+filter" requires one parameter, which should match one of the section
identifiers in the filter file itself. Example:

  +filter{html-annoyances}                                                     

This would activate that particular filter. Similarly, "+filter" can be turned
off for selected sites as: "-filter{html-annoyances}". Remember too, all
actions are off by default, unless they are explicity enabled in one of the
actions files.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

11. Templates

When Privoxy displays one of its internal pages, such as a 404 Not Found error
page (Privoxy must be running for link to work as intended), it uses the
appropriate template. On Linux, BSD, and Unix, these are located in /etc/
privoxy/templates by default. These may be customized, if desired.
cgi-style.css is used to control the HTML attributes (fonts, etc).

The default Blocked (Privoxy needs to be running for page to display) banner
page with the bright red top banner, is called just "blocked". This may be
customized or replaced with something else if desired.

13.2. History

Privoxy is evolved, and derived from, the Internet Junkbuster, with many
improvments and enhancements over the original.

Junkbuster was originally written by Anonymous Coders and Junkbusters
Corporation, and was released as free open-source software under the GNU GPL. 
Stefan Waldherr made many improvements, and started the SourceForge project
Privoxy to rekindle development. There are now several active developers
contributing. The last stable release of Junkbuster was v2.0.2, which has now
grown whiskers ;-).

15. Appendix

15.1. Regular Expressions

Privoxy can use "regular expressions" in various config files. Assuming support
for "pcre" (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions) is compiled in, which is the
default. Such configuration directives do not require regular expressions, but
they can be used to increase flexibility by matching a pattern with wild-cards
against URLs.

If you are reading this, you probably don't understand what "regular
expressions" are, or what they can do. So this will be a very brief
introduction only. A full explanation would require a book ;-)

"Regular expressions" is a way of matching one character expression against
another to see if it matches or not. One of the "expressions" is a literal
string of readable characters (letter, numbers, etc), and the other is a
complex string of literal characters combined with wild-cards, and other
special characters, called meta-characters. The "meta-characters" have special
meanings and are used to build the complex pattern to be matched against. Perl
Compatible Regular Expressions is an enhanced form of the regular expression
language with backward compatibility.

To make a simple analogy, we do something similar when we use wild-card
characters when listing files with the dir command in DOS. *.* matches all
filenames. The "special" character here is the asterisk which matches any and
all characters. We can be more specific and use ? to match just individual
characters. So "dir file?.text" would match "file1.txt", "file2.txt", etc. We
are pattern matching, using a similar technique to "regular expressions"!

Regular expressions do essentially the same thing, but are much, much more
powerful. There are many more "special characters" and ways of building complex
patterns however. Let's look at a few of the common ones, and then some
examples:

. - Matches any single character, e.g. "a", "A", "4", ":", or "@".

? - The preceding character or expression is matched ZERO or ONE times. Either/
or.                                                                            

+ - The preceding character or expression is matched ONE or MORE times.

* - The preceding character or expression is matched ZERO or MORE times.

\ - The "escape" character denotes that the following character should be taken
literally. This is used where one of the special characters (e.g. ".") needs to
be taken literally and not as a special meta-character. Example: "example      
\.com", makes sure the period is recognized only as a period (and not expanded 
to its meta-character meaning of any single character).                        

[] - Characters enclosed in brackets will be matched if any of the enclosed    
characters are encountered. For instance, "[0-9]" matches any numeric digit    
(zero through nine). As an example, we can combine this with "+" to match any  
digit one of more times: "[0-9]+".                                             

() - parentheses are used to group a sub-expression, or multiple               
sub-expressions.                                                               

| - The "bar" character works like an "or" conditional statement. A match is   
successful if the sub-expression on either side of "|" matches. As an example: 
"/(this|that) example/" uses grouping and the bar character and would match    
either "this example" or "that example", and nothing else.                     

s/string1/string2/g - This is used to rewrite strings of text. "string1" is    
replaced by "string2" in this example. There must of course be a match on      
"string1" first.                                                               

These are just some of the ones you are likely to use when matching URLs with
Privoxy, and is a long way from a definitive list. This is enough to get us
started with a few simple examples which may be more illuminating:

/.*/banners/.* - A simple example that uses the common combination of "." and "
*" to denote any character, zero or more times. In other words, any string at
all. So we start with a literal forward slash, then our regular expression
pattern (".*") another literal forward slash, the string "banners", another
forward slash, and lastly another ".*". We are building a directory path here.
This will match any file with the path that has a directory named "banners" in
it. The ".*" matches any characters, and this could conceivably be more forward
slashes, so it might expand into a much longer looking path. For example, this
could match: "/eye/hate/spammers/banners/annoy_me_please.gif", or just "/
banners/annoying.html", or almost an infinite number of other possible
combinations, just so it has "banners" in the path somewhere.

A now something a little more complex:

/.*/adv((er)?ts?|ertis(ing|ements?))?/ - We have several literal forward
slashes again ("/"), so we are building another expression that is a file path
statement. We have another ".*", so we are matching against any conceivable
sub-path, just so it matches our expression. The only true literal that must
match our pattern is adv, together with the forward slashes. What comes after
the "adv" string is the interesting part.

Remember the "?" means the preceding expression (either a literal character or
anything grouped with "(...)" in this case) can exist or not, since this means
either zero or one match. So "((er)?ts?|ertis(ing|ements?))" is optional, as
are the individual sub-expressions: "(er)", "(ing|ements?)", and the "s". The "
|" means "or". We have two of those. For instance, "(ing|ements?)", can expand
to match either "ing" OR "ements?". What is being done here, is an attempt at
matching as many variations of "advertisement", and similar, as possible. So
this would expand to match just "adv", or "advert", or "adverts", or
"advertising", or "advertisement", or "advertisements". You get the idea. But
it would not match "advertizements" (with a "z"). We could fix that by changing
our regular expression to: "/.*/adv((er)?ts?|erti(s|z)(ing|ements?))?/", which
would then match either spelling.

/.*/advert[0-9]+\.(gif|jpe?g) - Again another path statement with forward
slashes. Anything in the square brackets "[]" can be matched. This is using
"0-9" as a shorthand expression to mean any digit one through nine. It is the
same as saying "0123456789". So any digit matches. The "+" means one or more of
the preceding expression must be included. The preceding expression here is
what is in the square brackets -- in this case, any digit one through nine.
Then, at the end, we have a grouping: "(gif|jpe?g)". This includes a "|", so
this needs to match the expression on either side of that bar character also. A
simple "gif" on one side, and the other side will in turn match either "jpeg"
or "jpg", since the "?" means the letter "e" is optional and can be matched
once or not at all. So we are building an expression here to match image GIF or
JPEG type image file. It must include the literal string "advert", then one or
more digits, and a "." (which is now a literal, and not a special character,
since it is escaped with "\"), and lastly either "gif", or "jpeg", or "jpg".
Some possible matches would include: "//advert1.jpg", "/nasty/ads/
advert1234.gif", "/banners/from/hell/advert99.jpg". It would not match
"advert1.gif" (no leading slash), or "/adverts232.jpg" (the expression does not
include an "s"), or "/advert1.jsp" ("jsp" is not in the expression anywhere).

s/microsoft(?!.com)/MicroSuck/i - This is a substitution. "MicroSuck" will
replace any occurrence of "microsoft". The "i" at the end of the expression
means ignore case. The "(?!.com)" means the match should fail if "microsoft" is
followed by ".com". In other words, this acts like a "NOT" modifier. In case
this is a hyperlink, we don't want to break it ;-).

We are barely scratching the surface of regular expressions here so that you
can understand the default Privoxy configuration files, and maybe use this
knowledge to customize your own installation. There is much, much more that can
be done with regular expressions. Now that you know enough to get started, you
can learn more on your own :/

15.2. Privoxy's Internal Pages

Since Privoxy proxies each requested web page, it is easy for Privoxy to trap
certain special URLs. In this way, we can talk directly to Privoxy, and see how
it is configured, see how our rules are being applied, change these rules and
other configuration options, and even turn Privoxy's filtering off, all with a
web browser. 

The URLs listed below are the special ones that allow direct access to Privoxy.
Of course, Privoxy must be running to access these. If not, you will get a
friendly error message. Internet access is not necessary either.

  * Privoxy main page:
   
        http://config.privoxy.org/
       
    Alternately, this may be reached at http://p.p/, but this variation may not
    work as reliably as the above in some configurations.
   
  * Show information about the current configuration, including viewing and
    editing of actions files:
   
        http://config.privoxy.org/show-status
       
  * Show the source code version numbers:
   
        http://config.privoxy.org/show-version
       
  * Show the browser's request headers:
   
        http://config.privoxy.org/show-request
       
  * Show which actions apply to a URL and why:
   
        http://config.privoxy.org/show-url-info
       
  * Toggle Privoxy on or off. In this case, "Privoxy" continues to run, but
    only as a pass-through proxy, with no actions taking place:
   
        http://config.privoxy.org/toggle
       
    Short cuts. Turn off, then on:
   
        http://config.privoxy.org/toggle?set=disable
       
        http://config.privoxy.org/toggle?set=enable
       
These may be bookmarked for quick reference. See next. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

15.2.1. Bookmarklets

Below are some "bookmarklets" to allow you to easily access a "mini" version of
some of Privoxy's special pages. They are designed for MS Internet Explorer,
but should work equally well in Netscape, Mozilla, and other browsers which
support JavaScript. They are designed to run directly from your bookmarks - not
by clicking the links below (although that should work for testing).

To save them, right-click the link and choose "Add to Favorites" (IE) or "Add
Bookmark" (Netscape). You will get a warning that the bookmark "may not be
safe" - just click OK. Then you can run the Bookmarklet directly from your
favorites/bookmarks. For even faster access, you can put them on the "Links"
bar (IE) or the "Personal Toolbar" (Netscape), and run them with a single
click.

  * Privoxy - Enable
   
  * Privoxy - Disable
   
  * Privoxy - Toggle Privoxy (Toggles between enabled and disabled)
   
  * Privoxy- View Status
   
  * Privoxy - Submit Filter Feedback

15.3. Chain of Events

Let's take a quick look at the basic sequence of events when a web page is
requested by your browser and Privoxy is on duty:

  * First, your web browser requests a web page. The browser knows to send the
    request to Privoxy, which will in turn, relay the request to the remote web
    server after passing the following tests:
   
  * Privoxy traps any request for its own internal CGI pages (e.g http://p.p/)
    and sends the CGI page back to the browser.
   
  * Next, Privoxy checks to see if the URL matches any "+block" patterns. If
    so, the URL is then blocked, and the remote web server will not be
    contacted. "+handle-as-image" is then checked and if it does not match, an
    HTML "BLOCKED" page is sent back. Otherwise, if it does match, an image is
    returned. The type of image depends on the setting of "+set-image-blocker"
    (blank, checkerboard pattern, or an HTTP redirect to an image elsewhere).
   
  * Untrusted URLs are blocked. If URLs are being added to the trust file, then
    that is done.
   
  * If the URL pattern matches the "+fast-redirects" action, it is then
    processed. Unwanted parts of the requested URL are stripped.
   
  * Now the rest of the client browser's request headers are processed. If any
    of these match any of the relevant actions (e.g. "+hide-user-agent", etc.),
    headers are suppressed or forged as determined by these actions and their
    parameters.
   
  * Now the web server starts sending its response back (i.e. typically a web
    page and related data).
   
  * First, the server headers are read and processed to determine, among other
    things, the MIME type (document type) and encoding. The headers are then
    filtered as deterimed by the "+prevent-setting-cookies", 
    "+session-cookies-only", and "+downgrade-http-version" actions.
   
  * If the "+kill-popups" action applies, and it is an HTML or JavaScript
    document, the popup-code in the response is filtered on-the-fly as it is
    received.
   
  * If a "+filter" or "+deanimate-gifs" action applies (and the document type
    fits the action), the rest of the page is read into memory (up to a
    configurable limit). Then the filter rules (from default.filter) are
    processed against the buffered content. Filters are applied in the order
    they are specified in the default.filter file. Animated GIFs, if present,
    are reduced to either the first or last frame, depending on the action
    setting.The entire page, which is now filtered, is then sent by Privoxy
    back to your browser.
   
    If neither "+filter" or "+deanimate-gifs" matches, then Privoxy passes the
    raw data through to the client browser as it becomes available.
   
  * As the browser receives the now (probably filtered) page content, it reads
    and then requests any URLs that may be embedded within the page source,
    e.g. ad images, stylesheets, JavaScript, other HTML documents (e.g.
    frames), sounds, etc. For each of these objects, the browser issues a new
    request. And each such request is in turn processed as above. Note that a
    complex web page may have many such embedded URLs.
   
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

15.4. Anatomy of an Action

The way Privoxy applies "actions" and "filters" to any given URL can be
complex, and not always so easy to understand what is happening. And sometimes
we need to be able to see just what Privoxy is doing. Especially, if something
Privoxy is doing is causing us a problem inadvertently. It can be a little
daunting to look at the actions and filters files themselves, since they tend
to be filled with "regular expressions" whose consequences are not always so
obvious.

One quick test to see if Privoxy is causing a problem or not, is to disable it
temporarily. This should be the first troubleshooting step. See the
Bookmarklets section on a quick and easy way to do this (be sure to flush
caches afterward!).

Privoxy also provides the http://config.privoxy.org/show-url-info page that can
show us very specifically how actions are being applied to any given URL. This
is a big help for troubleshooting.

First, enter one URL (or partial URL) at the prompt, and then Privoxy will tell
us how the current configuration will handle it. This will not help with
filtering effects (i.e. the "+filter" action) from the default.filter file
since this is handled very differently and not so easy to trap! It also will
not tell you about any other URLs that may be embedded within the URL you are
testing. For instance, images such as ads are expressed as URLs within the raw
page source of HTML pages. So you will only get info for the actual URL that is
pasted into the prompt area -- not any sub-URLs. If you want to know about
embedded URLs like ads, you will have to dig those out of the HTML source. Use
your browser's "View Page Source" option for this. Or right click on the ad,
and grab the URL.

Let's try an example, google.com, and look at it one section at a time:

 Matches for http://google.com:                                                     
                                                                                    
--- File standard ---                                                               
(no matches in this file)                                                           
                                                                                    
--- File default ---                                                                
                                                                                    
{ -add-header -block +deanimate-gifs{last} -downgrade-http-version +fast-redirects  
 -filter{popups} -filter{fun} -filter{shockwave-flash} -filter{crude-parental}      
 +filter{html-annoyances} +filter{js-annoyances} +filter{content-cookies}           
 +filter{webbugs} +filter{refresh-tags} +filter{nimda} +filter{banners-by-size}     
 +hide-forwarded-for-headers +hide-from-header{block} +hide-referer{forge}

/                                                                                   
                                                                                    
 { -session-cookies-only }                                                          
 .google.com                                                                        
                                                                                    
 { -fast-redirects }                                                                
 .google.com                                                                        
                                                                                    
--- File user ---                                                                   
(no matches in this file)                                                           

This tells us how we have defined our "actions", and which ones match for our
example, "google.com". The first listing is any matches for the standard.action
file. No hits at all here on "standard". Then next is "default", or our
default.action file. The large, multi-line listing, is how the actions are set
to match for all URLs, i.e. our default settings. If you look at your "actions"
file, this would be the section just below the "aliases" section near the top.
This will apply to all URLs as signified by the single forward slash at the end
of the listing -- "/".

But we can define additional actions that would be exceptions to these general
rules, and then list specific URLs (or patterns) that these exceptions would
apply to. Last match wins. Just below this then are two explicit matches for
".google.com". The first is negating our previous cookie setting, which was for
"+session-cookies-only" (i.e. not persistent). So we will allow persistent
cookies for google. The second turns off any "+fast-redirects" action, allowing
this to take place unmolested. Note that there is a leading dot here --
".google.com". This will match any hosts and sub-domains, in the google.com
domain also, such as "www.google.com". So, apparently, we have these two
actions defined somewhere in the lower part of our default.action file, and
"google.com" is referenced somewhere in these latter sections.

Then, for our user.action file, we again have no hits.

And finally we pull it all together in the bottom section and summarize how
Privoxy is applying all its "actions" to "google.com": 

  Final results:                                                                   
 -add-header -block +deanimate-gifs{last} -downgrade-http-version -fast-redirects

 -prevent-setting-cookies -kill-popups -send-vanilla-wafer -send-wafer             

Notice the only difference here to the previous listing, is to "fast-redirects"
and "session-cookies-only".

Now another example, "ad.doubleclick.net":

  { +block +handle-as-image }                                                  
  .ad.doubleclick.net                                                          
                                                                               
 { +block +handle-as-image }                                                   
  ad*.                                                                         
                                                                               
 { +block +handle-as-image }                                                   
  .doubleclick.net                                                             

We'll just show the interesting part here, the explicit matches. It is matched
three different times. Each as an "+block +handle-as-image", which is the
expanded form of one of our aliases that had been defined as: "+imageblock". (
"Aliases" are defined in the first section of the actions file and typically
used to combine more than one action.)

Any one of these would have done the trick and blocked this as an unwanted
image. This is unnecessarily redundant since the last case effectively would
also cover the first. No point in taking chances with these guys though ;-)
Note that if you want an ad or obnoxious URL to be invisible, it should be
defined as "ad.doubleclick.net" is done here -- as both a "+block" and an 
"+handle-as-image". The custom alias "+imageblock" just simplifies the process
and make it more readable.

One last example. Let's try "http://www.rhapsodyk.net/adsl/HOWTO/". This one is
giving us problems. We are getting a blank page. Hmmm...

  Matches for http://www.rhapsodyk.net/adsl/HOWTO/:                                  
                                                                                     
 { -add-header -block +deanimate-gifs -downgrade-http-version +fast-redirects        
   +filter{html-annoyances} +filter{js-annoyances} +filter{kill-popups}              
   +filter{webbugs} +filter{nimda} +filter{banners-by-size} +filter{hal}             
   +filter{fun} +hide-forwarded-for-headers +hide-from-header{block}                 
   +hide-referer{forge} -hide-user-agent -handle-as-image +set-image-blocker{blank}  
   +prevent-compression +session-cookies-only -prevent-setting-cookies               
   -prevent-reading-cookies +kill-popups -send-vanilla-wafer -send-wafer }           
   /                                                                                 
                                                                                     
 { +block +handle-as-image }                                                         
  /ads                                                                               

Ooops, the "/adsl/" is matching "/ads"! But we did not want this at all! Now we
see why we get the blank page. We could now add a new action below this that
explicitly does not block ("{-block}") paths with "adsl". There are various
ways to handle such exceptions. Example:

  { -block }                                                                   
  /adsl                                                                        

Now the page displays ;-) Be sure to flush your browser's caches when making
such changes. Or, try using Shift+Reload.

But now what about a situation where we get no explicit matches like we did
with:

  { +block +handle-as-image }                                                  
 /ads                                                                          

That actually was very telling and pointed us quickly to where the problem was.
If you don't get this kind of match, then it means one of the default rules in
the first section is causing the problem. This would require some guesswork,
and maybe a little trial and error to isolate the offending rule. One likely
cause would be one of the "{+filter}" actions. Try adding the URL for the site
to one of aliases that turn off "+filter":

  {shop}                                                                       
 .quietpc.com                                                                  
 .worldpay.com   # for quietpc.com                                             
 .jungle.com                                                                   
 .scan.co.uk                                                                   
 .forbes.com                                                                   

"{shop}" is an "alias" that expands to "{ -filter -session-cookies-only }". Or
you could do your own exception to negate filtering: 

  {-filter}                                                                    
 .forbes.com                                                                   

This would probably be most appropriately put in user.action, for local site
exceptions.

"{fragile}" is an alias that disables most actions. This can be used as a last
resort for problem sites. Remember to flush caches! If this still does not
work, you will have to go through the remaining actions one by one to find
which one(s) is causing the problem.
