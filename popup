#  This is the configuration file for blocking Javascript popup windows,
# it specifies both hosts to block from, and hosts to allow the popups
# from.
#
#  The format is the hostname to block, or allow.
#
#  eg:
#
#  www.geocities.com       # block all popups from geocities.
#
#  ~www.trusted-host.com   # Allow popups from the trusted host domain.
#
#
#   If a site is not explicitly blocked popups will be allowed, the
# "allowable" syntax with "~" exists as a marker that you've explicitly
# allowed something.
#
#   Order is not relevant - an allowable entry overrides a blocked entry,
# e.g.
#  ~myhost.com    # Allows myhost.com
#  myhost.com     # _Still_ allowed.
