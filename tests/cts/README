This directory contains tests that leverage curl's test suite (cts).

For details about curl see: https://curl.se/

Some temporary hints are below:

From the parent directory of the directory with the
Privoxy sources do:

 git clone https://github.com/curl/curl.git

 cd curl
 git checkout -b before-cts-regressions 073268a6de3

 # Build curl as described in GIT-INFO. Note that the configure
 # call needs to explicitly choose a TLS library. For example
 # by adding "--with-openssl".

 # Install stunnel

 # Test that curl's tests are working without Privoxy
 make test

You can then cd back into privoxy/tests/cts and execute the
tests by running:

  run-privoxy-tests.sh

The script takes care of starting Privoxy with a configuration expected
by the tests. Note that unlike privoxy-regression-test.pl it currently
does not automatically check that Privoxy has been built with all the
features required for the tests to work and simply tries to execute
all tests.

The tests are divided into multiple test scenarios.

Each test scenario has its own subdirectory with a Privoxy
configuration file called privoxy.conf and a data directory
containing the test files.

The tests are written using the "curl test suite file format"
described at:
https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/tests/FILEFORMAT.md

One extension made is that a <proxy-reply> section is supported
which will be used when checking the test results instead of using
the <reply> section that would be used otherwise.

This extension is supported by loading a custom perl library
(privoxy-runtests.pm) when running runtests.pl. Loading the library
is done with runtests-wrapper.sh which also sets a couple of other
required options and is normally called through run-privoxy-tests.sh.
