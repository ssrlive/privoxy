# Lines beginning with a # character are comments; they are ignored.
# Many example lines are provided here commented out

# the blockfile contains patterns to be blocked by the proxy
blockfile      ./blocklist # comments are OK here, too

# the imagefile contains patterns to detect blocked images
imagefile      ./imagelist

# the popfile contains patterns of servers where javascript popups are disabled
#
# if the next line is not commented out, all javascript popups from the sites 
# that match the patterns in popup will be blocked

#re_filterfile   ./re_filterfile

# Uncomment to filter *all* traffic. Default is to

# the cookiefile contains patterns to specify the cookie management policy
#
cookiefile     ./cookiefile

# the logfile is where all logging and error messages are written
#
logfile        ./junkbuster.log

# the jarfile is where cookies can be stored
#
#jarfile    ./jarfile

# the forwardfile defines domain-specific routing
#
forwardfile    ./forward

# if logging cookies into a jarfile, and no other wafers were

#
# setting 'suppress-vanilla-wafer' stops this vanilla wafer from
# being sent.

# listen-address specifies where the Junkbuster will listen for connections
# Specifying a port is optional; if unspecified the defaults is 8000.
# Before Version 2.0.2 the default was to bind to all IP addresses (INADDR_ANY)
# This has been restricted to localhost to avoid unintended security breaches.
# To open the proxy to all, uncomment the following line:
#listen-address      :8000
# other example usage:
#listen-address      124.207.250.245:8080
# to explicitly state what is now the default:
#listen-address      localhost
# or equivalently:
listen-address    127.0.0.1:8000

# user-agent specifies treatment of the "User-Agent:" (and "UA-*:") header(s)
# default: Forge the "User-Agent:" 
# 'text' : Always send <text> as the "User-Agent:"
# .      : Pass the "User-Agent:" unchanged
# @      : Pass the "User-Agent:" if the server is in the cookie file,
#          forge the "User-Agent:" otherwise
#user-agent     @

# note: Russian browsers may be confused if user agent misidentifies
# the operating system (Mac vs Windows); see FAQ
user-agent    .

# referer specifies treatment of the "Referer:" header
# New option by "Andreas S. Oesterhelt" <oes@paradis.rhein.de>
#
# default: Kill the referrer-header from the client
# 'text' : Always send <text> as the referrer
# .      : Pass the referrer unchanged
# @      : Pass the referrer if the server is in the cookie file,
#          kill the referrer otherwise
# §      : Pass the referrer if the server is in the cookie file,
#       send a forged referrer that points to the root-diretory URL
#       of the current request otherwise
referer     §

# from specifies value to be subsituted if browser provides a "From:" header

# tinygif allows you to change the appearance of blocked images
#
# tinygif  0  # Show a "broken icon"
# tinygif  1  # Show a GIF of one transparent pixel
tinygif  2  # Show a GIF with the word "JUNKBUSTER"
# tinygif  3 http://localhost/1x1.gif   # Temporary redirect to this URL

# The following can be used to suppress display of the block lists when the
# page http://x.x/show-proxy-args is displayed. With a long block list this
# accelerates loading of the configuration page and also hides the contents of
# the block lists (for whatever reason). Maintainers of junkbuster proxies for 
# multiple use can specify a message for any use who wants to know what is in
# these files.

# debug sets the level of debugging information to log in the logfile
#
# debug         1 # GPC  = show each GET/POST/CONNECT request
# debug         2 # CONN = show each connection status
# debug         4 # IO   = show I/O status
# debug         8 # HDR  = show header parsing
# debug        16 # LOG  = log all data into the logfile
# debug        32 # FRC  = debug force feature
# debug        64 # REF  = debug regular expression filter 
#
# multiple "debug" directives, are OK - they're logical-OR'd together
#
#debug         15 # same as setting the first 4 listed above
debug 1
# debug 255        # Log *everything*

# single-threaded operation (i.e. disallows multiple threads or processes)
# This is most often used for debugging because it keeps the
# debugging output "in order" for easy reading.

# Toggle flag.  0 => disabled, anything else (ie. 1) => enabled
toggle 1
